--------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed the server, you MUST download a map set.
Note: this server has been tested only with 'bigworld maps'.

You have three options for maps:

1) Grab one of the installers for either 'smallworld maps' or 'bigworld maps'.

Launch it, point to where you installed Crossfire Server, install.


2) Grab map set from official SourceForge page.

The following sets are available:
* big world maps, at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13833&package_id=15918

Note: you need Winzip, ZipGenius, UltimateZip or equivalent to unzip the files.
Note: Make SURE that this tool will NOT convert Unix newline to Windows, else it will NOT work.

Unzip the maps in the share/maps of where you installed Crossfire Server
(typically C:\Program Files\Crossfire Server)


3) Get maps from CVS

This ensures you always have the latest maps.

CVS instructions for Crossfire are located at
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13833

Fire you favorite CVS tool, and get either 'maps' or 'maps-bigworld'
module.
Make SURE, ABSOLUTELY SURE, that your tool will NOT convert Unix newline
to Windows newline. It will NOT work if conversion occurs.

Move'em to share/maps of where you installed Crossfire Server.
(if you picked 'maps-bigworld', rename the directory to 'maps')


WARNING: server has only been tested with 'bigworld' maps. Small world
maps are not supported anymore.
