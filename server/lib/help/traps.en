I recommend the following keybindings

    'bind search
    s
    'bind disarm
    d

Then you can use the 's' and 'd' keys for searching for and disarming traps.

Traps appear at random in doors and in chests. Search those before you open them up. Search by going near where you suspect a trap, and type 's'
