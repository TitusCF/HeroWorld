After you have created your character, use the Numpad to move around, press <a> to apply (Enter Doors, Open Chests), press <,> to pick up
items off the ground, use RightClick to drop items from your inventory.

Useful commands are /who, /maps, /tell, /chat and /help.
Partys are formed using /party form <partyname>
Partys are joined using /party join <partyname>
(Experience is shared, help each other!)

This is an experimental fork, bugs should be reported to DM, Titus.
