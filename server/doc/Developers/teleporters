Teleporters

 'Updated 11/5/95 to include full documentation on teleporters (mwedel)'

  Teleporters operate in a manner similar to exits - when something is on a
teleporter, and the teleporter gets its movement, the object is then
teleported.  The main difference between that and normal exits is that normal exits
transport the person either when they step on it (auto_apply), or when they
apply it.  Teleporters operate without user control - you will get
teleported whether or not you want to. Also, teleporters have speed associated
with them - the way speed works.
with teleporters is the same as with other objects - when the teleporter
gets its chance to move, it teleports at that time.  Thus, if a teleporter
has a speed of 0.05, it would teleport something once very 20 ticks.

  Teleporters can be set to operate in three ways:

   1. Slaying (new map) with destination coordinates.  In this case, it
will teleport the player to the new map.

   2. Destination coordinates, but no maps supplied.  In this case, it will
teleport the object to the same map, new coordinates.

   3. No coordinates or map supplied.

   Note that there is a difference between #1 and #2 above even if the map
supplied is the map you are on.  If a map is provided, even if it is the
same map, only players will be teleported.  In the case of #2, all objects
will be teleported.  Thus, in most cases, if you are doing a same map
teleport, you want to leave the slaying field blank, so it will teleport all
objects.  In the case of #3, it will teleport you to any teleporter that is with 5
spaces of the source teleporter.  Note that for this to work, the destinatin
teleporter must either be the first or second object on the space (ie, if a
teleporter has 2 objects beneath it, it will not work).  Which teleporter
you go to is randomly determined.

  Now for special teleporters:

   By default, teleporters teleport anything which steps
on them to x,y,map (see map editor)  If you'd like to make
teleporters trigger off of something, you must:

   * make sure that the teleporter object has a speed of 0.
pentagrams have a speed of zero by default, other
teleporters must be modified using the map editor

   * give the teleporter a connected value.  You may use
any object to trigger the teleporter.  This includes
magic ears, which recognize words, buttons, levers,
altars, pedestals, perhaps even monsters.

   When the connected object is triggered, the teleporter
will trigger also, teleporting whomever is on it
someplace.

  NOTE: In order to teleport items other than players, the teleporter can not
have an exit path set.  This means that it must be moving the objects
between the same map.  Even if the exit path is set to this same map, the
teleporter will not work properly for transporting objects.
