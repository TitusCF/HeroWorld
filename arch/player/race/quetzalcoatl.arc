Description:
Quetzalcoatls are a strange mix of snake, bird, human, and a dash of the divine. They are able to manipulate objects with their claws. They are amazingly strong, very quick, and amazingly hardy, but quite stupid and impious (despite the dash of divinity). However, they are strongly magical in nature and usually have a vast reservoir of mana with which to cast any spell they're not too stupid to learn. Often, they're only able to grasp one basic fire spell.
Their strongly draconic nature makes them immune to fire and helps them with fire spells, but they are vulnerable to cold. They can grasp weapons, but their bizarre body shape prevents them from using armour, helmets, and other items of apparel intended for bipedal creatures with two arms, two legs, and a head. Their inability to use armour comes back to haunt them when they compare themselves with other races:  highly enchanted armour is usually more beneficial than dragonhide! The wings come in handy: they can use them to levitate, and their hide gets thicker as they gain power, compensating them somewhat for not being able to use armour.
