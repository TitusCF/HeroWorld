Changes for CVS top of tree:

Add new force archetype monk_no_use_weapon. It will be inserted into
inventories of monk players to prevent them from using weapons.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-01


Make bullet swarm fire small bullets instead of magic bullets. Previously
bullet swarm (which is an evocation spell) gave sorcery exp.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-28


Correct rune definitions. Some runes did use obsolete fields or had
inconsistent definitions.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-09-14


Many many changes since last entry due to new server code and 
maintenance efforts.  Highlights - large image support allows 
for images larger than 32x32 - many images consolidated for easier 
maintenance (ongoing).  Spell and skill code changes heavily
modified spells and skill arches (more arch based now).
four point animation added to most player race and classes, smoothing
images added to support smoothing code and ground arches changed
to accommodate.  Arches added for weather system, new monsters,
new items, new npcs, triggered traps and trigger marker added.
New images added for classic set as well.  See server changelog
for more info.  Hope to maintain this file better in the future.
TM 2004-01-26



Add archetypes from Todd Mitchell.  These add wolfs and bears,
with bodyparts for them.  Also changes races for readable scroll
objects so that scrollcase objects can be used.  Add ruined tower.
New images for some objects.
Commited by MSW 2002-08-20

Fix monster arcs that had incorrect wrists/foot (1 instead of 2)
Fix update_monster script that generated the errors in the first place.
Add body information to the player/old/*.arc for very old player files.
Move crown from misc directory to armour/helmet, add appropriate body_info.
Add needed body info for elven boots.
MSW 2002-07-15


Update arcs to use body_info for equipping items.
Update armor to use gen_sp_armour instead of last_heal.
can_use_shield added to necessary arcs.
Add dev/scripts directory, which contains some handy scripts I wrote
for updating on the items.
Add item_power to the armours - needs to be done for rest of equippable
items.
MSW 2002-07-14


MSW 2000-12-26:
Added new archetypes & god changes for new god code.  Changes by Jan E.,
checked in my MSW.

PeterM  2000-12-3:  Convert
protected/immune/vulnerable/armour to new PR system for
all arcs.

MSW 2000-12-3:
Commit for PR code.  General changes was to clean up archetypes that
were immune/protected/vulnerable to the same attacktype (ie, protected &
immune).  Disease code changed to use last_grace instead of armour for
contagious values.  Gods still need to be fixed up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSW 2000-11-22: talisman/ring_drain.arc - give object speed 0.1
so it will animate (animation already in place, just was not being
used.)

PeterM:  Totally reorganized player/*, splitting it into races and
classes.  Classes are themselves split into four main subtypes.  
New images from dnh were also added, as well as new classes/races.
See http://langmuir.eecs.berkeley.edu/~peterm/Race.html and
    http://langmuir.eecs.berkeley.edu/~peterm/Class.html




Changes for Crossfire 0.95.7:

ground/Lake/blake_*.png:  Remove transperancies from these images so they
display properly.  MSW 9/20/2000

ground/sea*png: Remove transperancies from png images since they should not
be transparent.  MSW 8/23/2000

door/Locked/key2.arc, misc/Container/bag.arc, misc/Container/bookshelf.arc,
misc/Container/cauldron.arc, misc/Container/chest_2.arc,
misc/Container/depositbox.arc, misc/Container/key_ring.arc,
misc/Container/mailbox.arc, misc/Container/pouch.arc,
misc/Container/r_sack.arc misc/Container/sack.arc: Remove the 'a' from the
objects name.  The client adds it anyways, so you see 'a a bag' for example,
but also when using the commands like 'drop that match on an item name, having
to match against the 'a ' is a bit non intuitive.  MSW 6/27/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.95.6:

also skills/holysymbol and lockpicks.
skills/tailsman.arc:  added nrof to archetype so these things will join.

---END BATCH UPDATE--- DAMN 9/17/1999

Give power crystal a weight of one.  This allows it to be picked up - msw

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.93.3:

Number of images cleaned up/improved/created by David Sundqvist.

Several new images/archetyps added - new wall types, dedicated altars for
the gods (very nicely looking), and some other changes by David.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.7

Cleaned up the dev directory some - got rid of a bunch of files that have
since been merged.  Also, got rid of things that should no longer be
applicable (via code changes), and stuff in which there was only and archetype
object - there should be enough examples out there on how to create new
archetyps.

Weight for some monsters updated to be in more in line with what should be
expected.

Editable cleaned up for a bunch of objects.

Half orc and halfling player types added.

Some archetyps for throwing added

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.6

Several objects added for Brian Thomas valley quest maps - some disabled
archetypes moved back into palce.

Changes for Crossfire 0.92.5

Many archetypes added for the kunji maps.

Changes for Crossfire 0.91.7

Many new archetypes added by Brian Thomas (thomas@nomad.astro.psu.edu).
These are spread out in many different directories.

Spectres are no longer animated.  In this way, invisibilty on them works
properly.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.5:

Changed editable value in some items so they appear in the proper
place for crossedit.

Moved all files in the 'item' directory into misc.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.4:

Added DarkOrange to xpm.template file.  Before, there were only
two oranges, and the dark orange was closer to a brown.

Cleaned up some of the X Pixmaps.  Eliminated some colors from the
various files that are not in the official xpm.template file.

Merged the soda archetypes in.  Like Chico, they were at least
partially colored as I transfered them.

Tried to clean up the directories some.  All spell effects should
now be in magic, where as items that are related to spells (wands,
books, horns, rods, etc) are in spells.  Either item or misc should
be removed, as the stuff in them seems like it could be placed
in the other directory.

Changes for crossfire 0.90.3:
Merged chico archetypes in their proper location, instead of being
in a separate directly.  Colored them as I went.
