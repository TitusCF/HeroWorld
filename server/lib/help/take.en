The take commands take object(s) on the space the player is standing on, and inserts them into the players inventory.

If no parameter is given, take will get the top object that can be taken and put it in the players inventory. If no object can be taken, that will be stated.

A parameter can be given to take. In this case, all object that have names that match the parameter will be picked up. Thus, if there is a 'sword of WOE', and 'sword +1' and a 'sword -3' on the ground, 'take sword' will pick all of them up.

By default, take is bound to the comma key, with no parameters. To change this, look at the bind command.
