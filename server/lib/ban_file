# BANFILE
# A file which contains users or sites which are banned from playing.
# wildcards can be used in the file.  Valid entries are put on seperate lines.
# For a ban to result, both the user and ip must be true.
# Note: Crossfire does not do a ip -> dns name, so matches for the
# second part must be by ip.
#
# Syntax is "user@ip.address".  Note that when actually putting in lines, the
# double quotes should be ignored.  user can be "*" to match any user.  The
# line may be prefixed by '~' to allow an entry.  The lines are matched in the
# given order; the first match is used.
#
# The ip address portion is done as a substring and not wildcard
# match.  Some examples, and results:
#
# "mark@tavern.us" - won't work - tavern.us would not match - must be ip
#                    address.
# "*@10.1.31.1"    - users from 10.1.31.1 will not be able to play.
# "*@10.1.31.*"    - will not work - * is not a wildcard for host matches.
# "*@10.1.31."     - will do above - every ip that has 10.1.31. will be banned.
# "*@10.1.31"      - will ban above, but would also ban things like
#                    "129.10.1.31".
# "mark@10.1.31.1" - user mark from 10.1.31.1 will not be able to play.
# "mark@"          - user mark will not be able to play.
# "mark@*"         - user mark will not be able to play - * matches any host
#                    name.
# "~mark@1.2.3.4"  - accept user mark from 1.2.3.4, regardless if a following
#                    line would forbid it.  For example, together with a
#                    following line "mark@*" would allow mark to play only if
#                    he connects from 1.2.3.4.
#
# Ip address can be determined by looking at the logs, or with the who command.
