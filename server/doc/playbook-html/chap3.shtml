<H1>Playing <em>Crossfire</em></h1>

<H2><a name="3.1.0">Section 3.1.  Basics</a></h2>

In this section, several basic bits of information are detailed in a concise
way in rough order of importance.  Various pointers to other sections of
this document will help you to round out your knowledge if you want to. All
of the available player commands are concisely explained in appendix <a
href="appA.html">A (commands)</a>. You can always get a summary of available
commands while playing the game; hit ``<samp>?</samp>'' for help.<p>

<h4><a name="3.1.1">How to do simple stuff</a></h4>

<Strong>Move around and attack</strong><p>
Movement is accomplished with the mouse, or
with the same keys that some rouge-like computer games use. To move using
the mouse, position the cursor over a square you wish to move to
in the view window
then click the right hand button. If you want to use the keys, here's a
simple diagram of where the various movement keys will take you:<p>
<center>
<a name="table_keys">
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><th>y</th><th></th><th>k</th><th></th><th>u</th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th><img src="fig/nwarrow.gif"></th><th><img src="fig/narrow.gif"></th><th><img src="fig/nearrow.gif"</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>h</th><th><img src="fig/warrow.gif"></th><th>.</th><th><img src="fig/earrow.gif"></th><th>l</th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th><img src="fig/swarrow.gif"></th><th><img src="fig/sarrow.gif"></th><th><img src="fig/searrow.gif"</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>b</th><th></th><th>j</th><th></th><th>n</th></tr>
</table>
</center>

The ``<samp>.</samp>'' refers to yourself; you don't move anywhere when you
press it.
In order to ``run'' in a particular direction (i.e. move continuously
without having to repeatedly punch the key) hold down the control
key then hit any movement key or the right hand mouse button to
start moving. Release the <samp>&ltcontrol&gt</samp> key when you wish to stop running. <p>

If you move into something, you will attack it. This means walls,
doors, and monsters will be damaged if you hit them. Players and
friendly monsters may also be attacked in this way, but only if
you set the peaceful flag to ``off''. To learn more about the combat
system see section <a href="chap3.html#3.2.1">combat</a>.<p>

<strong>Picking up items</strong><p>

To pickup items, move over the item, then either hit the ``<samp>,</samp>''
key or move the cursor over to the look window, position it over the desired
item and click the left mouse button. You will see the item appear in your
inventory window. If you pick up too much stuff, you won't be able to see it
all at once. Use the ``<samp>&lt</samp>'' and ``<samp>&gt</samp>'' keys to
rotate through the inventory list. <p>

<strong>Applying stuff: wear armour, wield a weapon, eat, and so on.</strong><p>
Most of the time, in order to manipulate or ``<samp>apply</samp>'' items you have
to be holding them. Move the cursor over to the desired item in the
inventory window. By using the middle button on the mouse, you may
toggle the status (ie between ``applied'' or ``unapplied'') of items.
Note that
some items when applied will be used up (they disappear from the
inventory window). Examples of these kind of
items include ``food''
<!--#include file="foodone.html"-->
, ``potions''
<!--#include file="potions.html"-->
and ``scrolls''
<!--#include file="scrolls.html"-->
To learn more
about the uses of various items see chapter <a href="chap6.html">6 (Equipment)</a>. <p>

<Strong>Shoot a ranged weapon</Strong><p>
Ranged weapons include bows
<!--#include file="bows.html"-->
wands
<!--#include file="wands.html"-->
rods
<!--#include file="rods.html"-->
, or horns
<!--#include file="horns.html"-->
. Apply the desired
weapon, then check to see that the <samp>Range:</samp> slot in the status
window indicates that item is ``readied'' (yes...you can have something
applied but not readied). If its not ready, use either the plus or minus
keys to rotate though all of the slots. Once readied, use the
``<samp>&lotshift&gt</samp>'' key followed by a movement key to fire the
object in that direction. Alternatively, place the cursor in the view
window, then hit the middle mouse button to fire. <p>

<strong>Enter a building or boat.</strong><p>
<!--#include file="guild.html"-->
Move over on top of the desired structure. Then hit either middle mouse
button while the cursor is on the icon of the structure in the look window,
or hit the <samp>A</samp> key. If there is a link to a map drawn of the ``inside''
you will be taken there. If no link exists, you will get the message
``<samp>the &ltstructure&gt is closed.</samp>''. <p>

<strong>Use a skill</strong><p>

 In order to use a skill, it must first be readied. You can ready any skill
you have with the <samp>ready_skill</samp> command. Also, some skills will
automatically be readied when you undertake certain actions. For example, if
you run into a hostile monster with a wielded weapon the <samp>melee
weapons</samp> skill is readied. A ready skill will show up in the stat
window in the <samp>Range:</samp> slot. If a skill doesn't appear in the
slot, rotate the range slot to check for the skill. When a skill is readied,
the range slot will appear as ``<samp>Skill:  &ltskill&gt</samp>''
(otherwise it appears as ``<samp>Skill: none</samp>'').  To use the skill,
make a ``ranged attack'' (ie hit the same keys or mouse button as for firing
a wand). To learn more about the skills system see chapter
<a href="chap5.html">5 (Skills)</a>. <p>

<strong>Cast a spell</strong><p> In order to ``<samp>cast</samp>'' spells
(either incantations or prayers), you must have the skills of
<samp>wizardry</samp> (incantations) or <samp>praying</samp> (prayers).
Possession of a ``talisman''
<!--#include file="talisman.html"-->
 or a ``holy symbol''
<!--#include file="holysymbol.html"-->
 will also allow you to respectively
<samp>cast</samp> incantations or prayers). You can only <samp>cast</samp>
those spells you have </em>learned</em>. Issue the meta-command <samp>`cast
&ltspell&gt</samp> to ready a spell in the <samp>Range:</samp> slot. To
``fire'' the spell, make a ranged attack. Note: if you don't have enough
mana an incantation will fail.  If you don't have enough grace a prayer
<em>may</em> work. For more information concerning the magic system see
chapter <a href="chap4.html">4 (Magic)</a>.<p>

<h4><a name="3.1.2">Saving the game and ending the <em>Crossfire</em> session:</a></h4>

The <samp>save</samp> command is to provide an emergency backup in case of a
game crash.  To save your player at the end of your game session you must
find a ``Bed to reality''
<!--#include file="savebed.html"-->
, move your player
over it and <samp>apply</samp> it (``<samp>A</samp>''). These beds can
usually be found in the inns and taverns dotted around the maps (especially
in cities). This prevents you just saving anywhere and forces you to finish
what you are doing and return somewhere safe.<p>

<h4><a name="3.1.3">About NPCs</a></h4>

<em>N</em>on <em>P</em>layer <em>C</em>haracters are special ``monsters''
which have ``intelligence''. Players may be able to interact with these
monsters to help solve puzzles and find items of interest. To speak with a
monster you suspect to be a NPC, simply move to an adjacent square to them
and push the double-quote, ie. <samp>"</samp>. Enter your message, and press
<samp>&ltreturn&gt</samp>. You can also use the meta-command
<samp>'say</samp> if you feel like typing a little extra.<p>

Other NPCs may not speak to you, but display intelligence with their
movement. Some monsters can be friendly, and may attack the nearest of your
enemies. Others can be ``pets'', in that they follow you around and help you
in your quest to kill enemies and find treasure.<p>


<h4><a name="3.1.4">Important special items</a></h4>

There are many special items which can be found in <em>Crossfire</em>, of
those shown below, the most important may be the signs. <p>

<UL>
<li><strong>Signs:</strong>
<!--#include file="sign.html"-->

Signs often have messages that might clue you in on quests and puzzles
or even refer you to NPCs. It is your job as a player to make sure you
read every sign to make sure you do not miss things. <p>

<li> <strong>Handles and Buttons:</strong>
<!--#include file="handbutt.html"-->

These items can often be manipulated to open up new areas of the map.
In the case of handles, all a player must do is apply the handle. In
the case of buttons, the player must move items over the button to
"hold" it down. Some of the larger buttons may need very large items to
be moved onto them, before they can be activated. <p>

<li> <strong>Gates and locked doors:</strong>
<!--#include file="gatedoor.html"-->

Gates are often tied to a handle or button and can only be opened by
manipulating the the handle/button. Doors that are locked can either be
smashed down by attacking the door, by using keys
<!--#include file="keys.html"-->
which can be found
throughout the game, or by picking the lock. <p>

<li> <strong>Pits:</strong>
<!--#include file="pit.html"-->

Pits can be doorways to new areas of the map too, but be careful, for
you could fall down into a pit full of ghosts or dragons and not be
able to get back out! <p>

<li> <strong>Break away walls:</strong>
<!--#include file="br_wall.html"-->

Are a common occurrence in <em>Crossfire</em> . These type of walls can be
"destroyed" by attacking them. Thus, sometimes it may be worth a
player's time to test the walls of a map for ``secret doors''. <p>

<li> <strong>Fire walls:</strong>
<!--#include file="fr_wall.html"-->

Will shoot missiles (including bullets, lightning, etc.) at players.
Some firewalls can be destroyed while others cannot. <p>

<li> <strong>Spinners and Directors:</strong>
<!--#include file="dir_spin.html"-->

These odd items will change the direction of any item flying over them,
such as missile weapons and spells. <p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="3.2.0">Matters of life and death</h2>


<h4><a name="3.2.1">Attack system</h4>

Every time you make an attack, your attack is classified with one or more
``attacktypes''. For example, an attack made with a ordinary sword
results in the attack being made with the attacktype of ``physical''.
For another example, if a Mage attacks with a fireball spell the
attack is made with the ``magic'' and ``fire'' attacktypes. In
similar fashion, a defender may be protected, vulnerable, or immune
to any attacktype. <p>

Here is a summary of the attack system; in fact, its a
bit more complicated. <p>

<strong>Hitting an opponent</strong><p>
 Several quantities are involved in
determining whether an attack will hit its target.  The attacker will hit if
his <samp>Wc</samp> is less than or equal to the defender's <samp>Ac</samp>
+ 1D20 (Note: 1D20 is a random number between 1 and 20) or if the D20 gives
a 20 (remember, both <samp>Wc</samp> and <samp>Ac</samp> improve as their
value drops <em>lower</em>).<p>

<strong>Damaging a hit opponent</strong><p>
Damages are randomly generated, with the magnitude of the random number
being based on the attacker's <samp>Dam</samp> stat.
If defender is immune to an attacktype
in the attack, he receives no damage, if he's protected he receives
half damage, if he's vulnerable to this kind of
attacktype, he receives double damage. For physical attacks, the percent
of your <samp>Arm</samp> value is subtracted from incoming damage.
Some magic weapons can ``slay'' various races of creatures. If the weapon
slays the defender, the attack damage is tripled. <p>


<h4><a name="3.2.2">Experience</h4>

Accumulation of experience will result in increasing the <samp>level</samp>
of the player's character. In a <em>Crossfire</em> game where skills are
<em>not</em> present, experience is only gained for removing traps and
killing monsters.  A player will gain a new <samp>level</samp> when their
experience total reaches a new amount in the hierarchy shown in the
following table:<p>

<center>
<a name="table_exp_level">
<table border=1 cellpadding = 5>
<tr><th>Level</th><th>Experience</th></tr>
<!--#include file="levels.html"-->
</table>
Relationship between experience and <samp>level</samp> for the first
10 levels.<p>
</center>

In the skills-based game, <em>several</samp> kinds of experience exist. The
<samp>score</samp> represents the ``<em>overall</em>'' proficiency of the
player and is the <em>sum</em> of all the differing kinds of experience
possessed.<p>

The player accumulates experience into various ``<em>experience
categories</em>'' according to their actions.
Another way of putting this is that you become better
at what you do most often and most successfully. For example,
a player who kills monsters with incantations gains experience in
casting incantations. A player who steals from creatures often will
get better at stealing, and so on.  <p>

Each experience category will have a <samp>level</samp> assigned to it based
on the amount of experience accumulated in it (using the same schedule shown
in the table above.)  Use the <samp>skills</samp> command to investigate
which skills your character has and to see the <samp>level</samp> of ability
you have in each experience category. See chapter <a href="chap5.html">5 (Skills)</a> for more
information about skills and skill-based experience.<p>

As an aside, monsters <em>also</em> are assigned a <samp>level</samp> of
proficiency and may gain experience. The main way which monsters gain
experience is by <em>killing</em> players! Beware going after a monster that
has killed several players, it will be much more difficult to challenge!


<h4><a name="3.2.3">Calculation of selected secondary stats</h4>

Both the primary stats and <samp>level</samp> of the character will influence
the secondary stats given below. In the skills-based game, the
appropriate experience category is identified for purposes of determining
which <samp>level</samp> is used in the calculation. In the non-skills
game, the <em>overall</em> <samp>level</samp> is always used.<p>

Note: categories
are given for the default settings, and this can be changed by the
server administrator<p>

Refer to table <a href="chap2.html#table_pri_eff">primary stat effects</a> if a quantity in a calculation is
left unexplained. <p>

<strong>Weapon class (<samp>Wc</samp>)</strong><p>
The <samp>Wc</samp> calculation is:
<p><quote>
class <samp>Wc</samp> - <samp>thaco</samp>(STR) - weapon <samp>Wc</samp> - <samp>level</samp> - 1 every 6 <samp>level</samp>s
</quote><p>

where <samp>thaco</samp> is found using the STR stat on table <a
href="chap2.html#table_pri_eff">primary stat effects</a>, the weapon
<samp>Wc</samp> can be determined from the <a
href="../spoiler-html/spoiler.html">Crossfire Spoiler</a> and the
<samp>level</samp> is taken from the <samp>physique</samp> experience
category. <p>

<strong>Weapon Speed</strong><p>

The calculation for weapon speed is quite complex (but here it is!).
The value for the weapon speed is:<p>
<quote>
<samp>speed</samp>/(<samp>LF</samp> * <em>NastyFactor</em> * <em>LessNastyFactor</em>)<p>
</quote>

where <samp>LF</samp> (``level factor'') is a number between 0.8 and 1.2
that increases with the <samp>level</samp> as
(4+<samp>level</samp>)/(6+<samp>level</samp>)*1.2, (the <samp>level</samp>
is taken from the overall <samp>level</samp>), and both <em>NastyFactor</em>
and <em>LessNastyFactor</em> are calculated below.<p>

The value of <em>NastyFactor</em> is:<p>
<quote>
2/3 + <samp>MaxC</samp>/363 - ((0.00167*<samp>WpnW</samp>)/<samp>MaxC</samp>) + (<samp>speed</samp>/5) + ((Dex-14)/28)
</quote><p>

where <samp>MaxC</samp> is the maximum carrying
limit of the character, <samp>WpnW</samp> is
the weapon weight. Weapon weight can be determined from examining the given
weapon (ie look at the number to the right side of the weapon icon in the
inventory window).<p>

The value of <em>LessNastyFactor</em> is:<p>
<quote>
2 - ((WpnF - <samp>magic</samp>/2)/10)
</quote>
where <samp>WpnF</samp> is the ``weapon factor'' and <samp>magic</samp> is the
value of the enchantment on the weapon (i.e. +1, +2, etc.).
Weapon factor is given for some weapons
in the table below. <p>

<center>
<a name="table_weap_factor">
<table border=1 cellpadding = 5>
<tr><th>  1.6 </th><th> nunchacu </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.5 </th><th> dagger </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.4 </th><th> Sting, katana, shortsword, taifu </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.3 </th><th> Belzebub's sword, Darkblade, Excalibur </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.2 </th><th> Firebrand, Frostbrand, Mjoellnir, Mournblade,
	Stormbringer, broadsword, falchion, light sword <
	long sword, quarterstaff, sabre, sword, trident </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.1 </th><th> Deathbringer, Demonbane, Dragonslayer, Holy Avenger
	club, hammer, mace, unicorn horn </th></tr>
<tr><th>  1.0 </th><th> axe, stonehammer </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.9 </th><th> Skullcleaver, morningstar, stake, stoneaxe </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.8 </th><th> large morningstar </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.5 </th><th> Bonecrusher, Gram, shovel </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.3 </th><th> large club </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.1-0.4 </th><th> chair </th></tr>
<tr><th>  0.1 </th><th> bed </th></tr>
</table>
Weapon factor (<samp>WpnF</samp>) for selected weapons<p>
</center>



<h4>Damage (<samp>Dam</samp>)</h4>

Current weapon, character class (table <a
href="chap2.html#table2.2>character classes</a>) and STR (<samp>DmB</samp>
in table <a href="chap2.html#table_pri_eff">primary stat effects</a>) all
effect the value of <samp>Dam</samp>. The calculation for <samp>Dam</samp>
is:<p>

<quote> Class bonus + <samp>DmB</samp> + Weapon damage + Skill damage
<p> </quote>

In addition, for every 4 levels of fighting expertise (<samp>physique</samp>
experience category level) 1+(<samp>Dmb</samp>/5)) is added to
<samp>Dam</samp>.  Some skills (namely the hand-to-hand, or martial arts
skills) can add significant damage to the overall total. The amount that is
added depends on the user's <samp>level</samp> in that skill.  Note that
weapon damage is automatically added to your damage rating in the stat
window when you wield any weapon.


<h4>Armour class (<samp>Ac</samp>)</h4>

For characters that cannot wear armour (ex. Fireborn), their <samp>Ac</samp>
can improve as their score increases. The calculation for <samp>Ac</samp> is
then: <p>

<quote>
Class <samp>Ac</samp> - <samp>level</samp>/3<p>
</quote>

The value of the character <samp>Ac</samp> may decrease to the value of -10.
After that, no more improvement is made regardless of earned
experience. The overall <samp>level</samp> is
<em>always</em> used for this calculation.


<h4>Hit points (<samp>Hp</samp>)</h4>

A character will gain the following number of <samp>Hp</samp> for <em>each</em<
new overall <samp>level</samp> gained between levels 1-10:<p>

<quote>
(<samp>HpB</samp>)/2 + D4 + D4 + 1 + 1/every even <samp>level</samp>
<em>if</em> <samp>HpB</samp> is even.<p>
</quote>

Where D4 is a random number between 1 and 4 and you always get 1 hit point
gained per <samp>level</samp>, regardless of <samp>HpB</samp>.  For levels
after 10th, <samp>Hp</samp> grow 2 per <samp>level</samp>.  The overall
<samp>level</samp> provides the correct value for <samp>level</samp> in the
calculation.


<h4>Mana (<samp>Sp</samp>)</h4>

A character will gain the following number of <samp>Sp</samp> for <em>each</em> new
<samp>magic</samp> experience category <samp>level</samp> gained between levels 1-10:<p>

<quote>
(<samp>MgB</samp>(POW))/2 + D3 + D3 + 1 every even <samp>level</samp> <em>if</em> <samp>MgB</samp> is even.<p>
</quote>

Where D3 is a random number between 1 and 3 and you always get 1 mana gained
per new <samp>level</samp>. For <samp>magic</samp> levels past the 10th,
mana grows 2 per level.


<h4>Grace (<samp>Gr</samp>)</h4>

A character will gain the following number of <samp>Gr</samp> for <em>each</em> new
<samp>wisdom</samp> experience category <samp>level</samp> gained between levels 1-10:<p>

<quote>
(<samp>MgB</samp>(WIS) + <samp>MgB</samp>(POW))/8 + D3<p>
</quote>
Where D3 is a random number between 1 and 3 and you always get 1 grace gained
per new <samp>level</samp>. For levels past the 10th,
grace grows 1 per <samp>wisdom</samp> <samp>level</samp>.

<h4><a name="3.2.4">Death --- the ultimate penalty?</h4>

Should your hit point total drop below 0 you will die
<!--#include file="gravestone.html"-->
What happens next depends on how the game is compiled. If the
<samp>NOT_PERMDEATH</samp> option is being
used (this is the default) then your character (and his all of his
<em>carried</em>
equipment at the instant of death) will appear in the base map (the one
you first started out in). <p>

For each time you die, your character loses 20% of their experience (in all
categories) and a random primary stat decreases by 1.  At low levels, the
stat loss is bad news, while it is the experience loss that <em>really</em>
hurts at those high levels. You may still re-gain lost stats (up to your
natural limit) by drinking potions.<p>

If the server administrator has made death permanent, there is still hope
for your character. When the <samp>RESURRECTION</samp> option is enabled (the default option
when <samp>NOT_PERMDEATH</samp> is <em>not</em> being used) other characters may bring you back
from the beyond. There are 3 spells that are capable of doing this, but
remember to retrieve the corpse
<!--#include file="corpse.html"-->
of the character
that is to be resurrected! <p>


<h2><a name="3.3.0">Some advanced stuff</h2>

<h4><a name="3.3.1">Some useful advanced commands</h4>

<h4>Meta-command (<samp>'</samp>)</h4>

Any command listed by the use of help (<samp>?</samp> key) can be used by
spelling it out after the meta-command is issued. For example, you can use
the command <samp>say</samp> either by hitting the double-quote
(<samp>"</samp> key) or by issuing the command string <samp>'say</samp>.

<h4>Binding commands (<samp>'bind</samp> and <samp>'unbind</samp>)</h4>

You may bind any key with a complex command. For example, you could bind the
use of the meditation skill to the key ``<samp>m</samp>''. To do this first
type:<p>

<quote>
<samp>'bind use_skill meditation </samp> <p>
</quote>

then press <samp>&ltreturn&gt</samp>. The game will then ask you for a key to bind the
command to, you then hit <samp>m</samp>. You can also re-bind this key to something
else later if you wish too. Issue the command:<p>
<quote>
<samp>'unbind reset </samp> <p>
</quote>
to totally reset bindings on keys. <p>

<h4>Pick up toggle (<samp>@</samp>)</h4>

This allows you to change your pickup status. Eight different modes
for pick up exist: ``don't pick up'',``pick up 1 item'', ``pick up 1 item and
stop'', ``stop before picking up'', ``pick up all items'', pick up all items
and stop'', ``pick up all magic items'', ``pick up all coins and gems''.
Whenever you move over a pile of stuff your pickup mode controls
if and what you collect. You can always pickup stuff using the pickup
command (<samp>,</samp>) regardless of your current pickup mode. <p>

<h4>Invoke (<samp>'invoke</samp>)</h4>

A useful way to quickly cast both incantations and prayers is via the invoke
command. To use it effectively, <samp>bind invoke &ltspell&gt</samp> to any
key. Then, when that binded key is pressed, your character will cast that magic
in the direction they're currently facing.

<h4><a name="3.3.2">Playing with other people</h4>

As a general rule, other <em>Crossfire</em> players will prefer to
co-operate or at least leave each other alone. If you go about killing other
player's characters you may not only risk their continued wrath, but the
anger of the server administrator as well. Check out the house rules before
you start slaying players.<p>

<h4>Useful multi-player commands</h4>

Here are some useful commands for playing with other players:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>shout</strong>
This meta-command will broadcast your message to every player currently
logged in. The say command only sends messages to players who share your
current map. Invoke this command just like <samp>say</samp>.<p>

<li><strong>who</strong>
This will give you a listing of all the current players and the maps
they are on currently. Invoke this command as <samp>'who</samp>.<p>

<li><strong>tell</strong>
Will send your message only to the player indicated. It is invoked as:
<samp>'tell &ltcharacter name&gt &ltmessage string&gt</samp>.<p>
</ul>

<h4>The simple party system</h4>

If the <samp>SIMPLE_PARTY_SYSTEM</samp> has been enabled on your server you
can use this to adventure with other players. All experience gained by
members of the party is split equally, and in addition, party members are
always peaceful towards each other. Here's 2 useful party commands:<p>

1) To form a party issue the command: <p>
<quote>
<samp>'party form &ltparty name&gt</samp><p>
</quote>

2) To join a party, type:<p>
<quote>
<samp>'party join &ltparty name&gt</samp><p>
</quote>
To see all of the options, type <samp>'party help</samp>.
