MSW 2011-01-26

Tweak base value of some weapons.
MSW 2010-11-26

Update dragon players to provide a choice for starting focus for clients
that support it.

Mark cannon archetypes as "no_pick 1".
Andreas Kirschbaum 2010-11-06

Fix incorrect type 139 (IDENTIFY_ALTAR) for pyromaniac.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2010-11-06

Changes for new character creation:
system/map.arc: Add subtype to existing starting map, add new ones for
  player to be able to choose.
player/...: Make race/class names lowercase - most already were, so make
   few that were not lowercase so they are all consistent.
MSW 2010-10-20

Fix incorrect svn properties, for example .png should not have svn:keywords
set, that could in worst case result in corruption. While we are updating
properties anyway, clean up incorrect (but mostly harmless) svn:mime-type,
svn:executable and so on.
Arvid Norlander 2010-10-11

Copy descriptions (msg/endmsg) from HallOfSelection map to class archetypes.
Comment out some class archetypes that are currently unused - may get
re-used with class rebalancing.
MSW 2010-06-17

Move various road/path/bridge arches from the wall and construct folders into
a new road folder to make them easier to locate by folder name when working
in gridarta.  Road items in the river and planes foldersare unmoved as they
are stylistically tied very hard to the arches in those locations.  Affected:
  construct/s_bridge*          --> road/s_bridge/*
  construct/bridge/footbridge  --> road/footbridge
  construct/bridge/stonebridge --> road/stonebridge
  construct/town/a_bridge*     --> road/a_bridge
  wall/paved                   --> road/paved

Kevin Bulgrien 2010-06-15

Add giant_leader and giant_chief arches created by Jesse F. Hughes
Brendan Lally 2010-06-11

Upgrade the dirtroad arch set to include a basic set of diagonals that allow
the zig-zag diagonal roads to be converted to a more realistic looking road.
Additional diagonal tiles are able to be added, but these offer a significant
enough improvement to stand on their own.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-06-07

Major update of Naming.doc to improve description of existing content and add
information on how to name related Objects in the .arc file.  Add a new naming
convention that offers a standard way of naming diagonal items like walls and
roads.  The diagonal naming merges well with the legacy naming and uses a
similar hex/bit-based notation and avoids use of compass points like NE, SW,
etc. in the file name (that do not merge for arches with many connecting
points).  Add a note suggesting that the "river" naming be deprecated in favor
of the new "extended" wall naming scheme as it is more flexible than the
original river notation.  Because the notation is based on the existing wall
format, it is also conceivable that an "auto-router" for diagonals could be
developed in the future.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-06-07

Update several archetypes which had type of CLASS (37) but were not in
fact class archetypes and instead more often used as NPC or monsters.
Remove type so they default to monsters and give them some real stats.
Also fixes bug in that requestinfo class_list would return these bogus
entries.
MSW 2010-05-20

Update player race descriptions to explicitly state skills, resistances
and other special ability - makes it easier to see what one gets without
needing to read full description.
MSW 2010-05-20

Add faces for timer and time events
Brendan Lally 2010-05-15

Add faces for pickup, drop, apply, say and death events, so that they are
more easily identifiable in gridarta
Brendan Lally 2010-05-15

Move dev/wip/manhole to connect/Hole as it is tested and ready to use.  The
test patch is removed as it is out of date, and the README is moved to the
Hole directory as documentation.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-05-13

Add a ships wheel based on a heavily modified down-scale of an image found at
dreadnoughtproject.org.  Permission obtained for use of the image as a model
to produce this free image.  Other use of the original image is not free.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-05-13

Add large wood and iron ships anchor created from a public domain image.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-05-10

Add Wheelbarrow This uses an image drawn by Kevin Bulgrien.
Brendan Lally 2010-04-28

Change the names of dragon scales and dragon mail to be red dragon
scales/mail, this makes the naming consistant with green/blue/orange/etc
dragon stuff. The arch names are not changed, so existing items will inherit
the name change smoothly unless they have set a custom name.
Brendan Lally 2010-04-27

Add NPC_Gift_Box, a no-drop container that can be put in NPCs inventory to
hold items they should be able to give away, but not drop on being killed.
Brendan Lally 2010-04-26

Change AC of doors to make them easier to hit.  Doors in general should not
be difficult to hit.
MSW 2010-04-25

Add a new subtype for the magic mouths so that the client does not get invalid
(zero) type codes.  The magic mouth is a sign, but a very unique sign, so a
new sign subtype is added just for the magic mouth.
Kevin Bulgrien 2010-03-30

Modify pentagram and glyph msg/endmsg to indicate limitations and to add an
example of use.
Kevin Bulgrien 2009-08-08

Add the last of the msg/endmsg descriptions, fixing some previously entered
without the msg/endmsg tags.  A few non-player spells still do not have
descriptions.  They are:  spell_create_lava.arc, spell_shell.arc,
spell_regen_sp.arc, spell_haste.arc, spell_heroism.arc.
Kevin Bulgrien 2009-07-30

Add msg/endmsg descriptions to various spells with names starting with R.

the letters N-P and update Conflict.  Fix Slow (prior commit did not include
msg/endmsg tags around the message).

names that begin with the letters D through K.
Kevin Bulgrien 2009-07-24

Add msg/endmsg descriptions to spells with names that begin with C and the
antimagic rune skipped previously.
Kevin Bulgrien 2009-07-21

Add msg/endmsg descriptions to spells A-B that do not have them (except for
antimagic rune).  This allows the descriptions to be displayed in the client
spell window.

Pixies get wands/staffs. So make them use these items.

wall/slevel/dlevel.arc: Add new depression graphics to support drawing of
  diagonal channels.  These arches support the south edges of the diagonal
  channels.  Additional tiles are needed for the north edges.  The idea behind
  these graphics are to allow depressions to contain rivers or lava streams
  that are flowing in diagonal directions.  Another idea is to make slots that
  rolling boulders could follow.  A map is being developed that uses these
  graphics.
Kevin Bulgrien 2009-06-01

food/fish.arc: Make the item fishing_pole work (this item is not found on any
map currently). The fish in shallow_sea inventory didn't have harvestable set.

skills/karate.arc, punching.arc, flame_touch.arc, one_handed_weapons.arc,
missile_weap.arc, throwing.arc, clawing.arc, two_handed_weapons.arc,
wraith_feed.arc:  Related to server change 11576 - add wc_increase_rate
to these skills - for non weapon using skills, make that a lower value so
that it should be better balanced, and also give it a starting bonus.

flesh/dragon/dragon_sca.arc
Give dragons scales object type 73 (inorganic), this avoids alerts in
server logs: "Query_cost: item green dragon scale hasn't got a valid type"
but with all scale colors.  Note: object type 72 (flesh) caused the dragon
scales weight to increase from 25Kg to 50000Kg and made the scales edible -
neither is desirable.
Rick Tanner 2009-01-31

misc/t_boulder.arc
Give throwing boulders object type 15 (weapon), this avoids this alert in
the server logs: "Query_cost: item boulder hasn't got a valid type"

mapbuilding/mbwindow.base.111.png: New image
Raphaël Quinet 2008-08-04

mapbuilding/building.arc, mapbuilding/building.trs: Added new buildable
fence.  This is useful for those who want walls that do not block the view.
Fixed a bug in the treasure list shop_building_pupland that prevented it
from including any walls (replaced the treasure list
build_material_floor_pupland by building_material_stonewall_pupland).
mapbuilding/mbswall_0.base.111.png: New image.
Raphaël Quinet 2008-08-03

Re-add misc/machine.arc and machine.base.x11.png under the GFDL after obtaining
permission from the original author to relicense the image under the GFDL or
the GPL as appropriate. Though neither does address images, the GFDL has been
applied to images by other organizations and is somewhat clearer in how it may
be applied to graphic art.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-12

Remove misc/machine.arc and machine.base.x11.png and newly added LICENCE (as it
was added specifically to address Creative Commons licensing) due to concerns
about Creative Commons ShareAlike licensing requirements, and most especially
concerning a possible perception that this project or a distribution might be
construed to be a "collection" as defined by Creative Commons.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-11

Correct the license text to show that this derivation is released under
version 3.0 Creative Commons licensing to improve compatibility with
Debian.

Add misc/machine.arc, misc/machine.base.x11.png under terms of a Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license described in misc/machine.arc and
as an attributed derivative work of a copyrighted image.  The inspiration
for this graphic was provided by Yann (gros) Chachkoff.  Added a LICENSE
file to communicate the fact that this type of license now governs some
material in the arch collection.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-10

Rework dev/wip/spout to make water wider and more visible.  Also adjust the
color to better match the sea arch set.  Add a reference layer of a sea tile
to spout.xcf.  Convert all the .png files to indexed mode to reduce size.
Update README with methods used to produce the graphics and remove comments
about issues with the original revision.  The .arc files have been modified
to add 'map_layer item' to prevent wall pieces from disappearing when these
archs are placed on top of them.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-09

Add a set of "overlay" archs that are designed to sit on top of walls to form
a spout with water pouring out.  The art is designed to separate the liquid
and spout to allow spout and fluid variations.  The archs are WIP because they
cause the wall underneath them to disappear.  This is probably a map layer
issue.  It may not take much to fix, but are not presently releasable.
The files are in dev/wip/spout, and are: pour_h2o.arc, pour_h2o.base.111.png,
pour_h2o.base.112.png, pour_h2o.base.113.png, pour_h2o.base.114.png,
pour_h2o.face, pour_spout.arc, pour_spout.base.111.png, README, spout.xcf.
Note that maps/trunk/unlinked/kbulgrien/rayvins_house.1 contains these arches.

Add wall/wall/wall_door_0.base.111.png and wall_door_1.base.111.png to make
it possible to have tight-fitting doors (no gaps due to perspective) in the
wall arch set.  wall/wall/wall.arc modified.  Decided to use the numbering
of the window archs.  Also, per naming of the stwall window archs, rename
wall/stwall/stwall_2_door.base.111.png and stwall_5_door.base.111.png to
stwall_door_1.base.111.png and stwall_door_0.base.111.png and update
stwall.arc.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-08

Add wall/stwall/stwall_2_door.base.111.png and stwall_5_door.base.111.png to
make it possible to have tight-fitting doors (no gaps due to perspective).
wall/stwall/stwall.arc modified.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-07

Add wall/slevel/dlevel*.png and wall/slevel/dlevel.arc.  The slevel arches are
raised "elevation" marks that are supposed to overlay other tiles to give the
appearance of a raised platform.  The dlevel arches are the same graphics but
flipped in X and/or Y as appropriate to present a depression.  Both arch sets
rely on the Crossfire perspective to give the hint of a ridge or depression.
In an elevation, the leading edges are long and the receding edges are short.
For the depression the leading edges are short and receding edges long.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-07

Add wall/bwall/bwall_hole_5.base.111.png,wall/bwall/bwall_hole_A.base.111.png,
and wall/bwall/bwall_hole.arc.  The vertical wall has a transparent hole in
the left face, and the horizontal wall has a transparent hole in the bottom
face.  The holes could be drains for flowing rivers, or might even be an exit.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-01-07

Add dev/wip directory for commiting work-in-progress archetypes.  The directory
is not visible in Gridarta CrossfireEditor, but can be made so with a soft link
like arch/trunk/wip --> arch/trunk/dev/wip.
Add dev/wip/README describing the use of the directory.
Add dev/wip/manhole as a manhole archetype work-in-progress to facilitate some
collaboration on getting a multi-tile HOLE animation to work.  Included is a
README and a world_105_115.patch test case.

Start splitting server/lib/treasures file in many files.
Rename player class files/random items for coherence.
Nicolas Weeger 2007-03-17

Converted all remaining multi-part base images into single images
with the facename.base.x??.png format.  Deleted the old multi-part
images and adjusted the archetypes accordingly.  This is a huge
commit, but I thought it best to do it all in one commit so that if
something is horribly wrong, it can be reverted with one command.
Most of the conversion was automated, so if there's a problem I'm not
seeing, it probably affects them all.
Aaron Baugher 2007-02-16


Created addition shoreline tiles for the ground/sea.arc tile set to
add sea_F.base.111.png and sea_F.clsc.111.png that form a round pool
surrounded by transparency.  This tile might be used to fix indoor
water pools by providing a replacement for blake_0 which has grass
surrounding the water.  Also modified sea.arc accordingly.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-02-12


Created additional shoreline tiles for the sea.arc tile set to
fix some maps that use the blake.arc tile set to allow shorelines
to have rounded edges instead of corners.  The blake.arc tile set
is not the same color as the sea.arc tile set unless you are using
the classic png's, so the seas sometimes are shown in different
colors of blue.  The tiles added are "coves" that have transparency
on three sides.  The naming convention used is consistent with the
big lake tile set.  The naming.doc rules for walls is followed if
you consider a shoreline to be a sort of wall.
Kevin Bulgrien 2007-02-10

Make bullet swarm fire small bullets instead of magic bullets. Previously
bullet swarm (which is an evocation spell) gave sorcery exp.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-28


Correct rune definitions. Some runes did use obsolete fields or had
inconsistent definitions.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-09-14


Many many changes since last entry due to new server code and
maintenance efforts.  Highlights - large image support allows
for images larger than 32x32 - many images consolidated for easier
maintenance (ongoing).  Spell and skill code changes heavily
modified spells and skill arches (more arch based now).
four point animation added to most player race and classes, smoothing
images added to support smoothing code and ground arches changed
to accommodate.  Arches added for weather system, new monsters,
new items, new npcs, triggered traps and trigger marker added.
New images added for classic set as well.  See server changelog
for more info.  Hope to maintain this file better in the future.
TM 2004-01-26



Add archetypes from Todd Mitchell.  These add wolfs and bears,
with bodyparts for them.  Also changes races for readable scroll
objects so that scrollcase objects can be used.  Add ruined tower.
New images for some objects.
Commited by MSW 2002-08-20

Fix monster arcs that had incorrect wrists/foot (1 instead of 2)
Fix update_monster script that generated the errors in the first place.
Add body information to the player/old/*.arc for very old player files.
Move crown from misc directory to armour/helmet, add appropriate body_info.
Add needed body info for elven boots.
MSW 2002-07-15


Update arcs to use body_info for equipping items.
Update armor to use gen_sp_armour instead of last_heal.
can_use_shield added to necessary arcs.
Add dev/scripts directory, which contains some handy scripts I wrote
for updating on the items.
Add item_power to the armours - needs to be done for rest of equippable
items.
MSW 2002-07-14


MSW 2000-12-26:
Added new archetypes & god changes for new god code.  Changes by Jan E.,
checked in my MSW.

PeterM  2000-12-3:  Convert
protected/immune/vulnerable/armour to new PR system for
all arcs.

MSW 2000-12-3:
Commit for PR code.  General changes was to clean up archetypes that
were immune/protected/vulnerable to the same attacktype (ie, protected &
immune).  Disease code changed to use last_grace instead of armour for
contagious values.  Gods still need to be fixed up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MSW 2000-11-22: talisman/ring_drain.arc - give object speed 0.1
so it will animate (animation already in place, just was not being
used.)

PeterM:  Totally reorganized player/*, splitting it into races and
classes.  Classes are themselves split into four main subtypes.
New images from dnh were also added, as well as new classes/races.
See http://langmuir.eecs.berkeley.edu/~peterm/Race.html and
    http://langmuir.eecs.berkeley.edu/~peterm/Class.html




Changes for Crossfire 0.95.7:

ground/Lake/blake_*.png:  Remove transperancies from these images so they
display properly.  MSW 9/20/2000

ground/sea*png: Remove transperancies from png images since they should not
be transparent.  MSW 8/23/2000

door/Locked/key2.arc, misc/Container/bag.arc, misc/Container/bookshelf.arc,
misc/Container/cauldron.arc, misc/Container/chest_2.arc,
misc/Container/depositbox.arc, misc/Container/key_ring.arc,
misc/Container/mailbox.arc, misc/Container/pouch.arc,
misc/Container/r_sack.arc misc/Container/sack.arc: Remove the 'a' from the
objects name.  The client adds it anyways, so you see 'a a bag' for example,
but also when using the commands like 'drop that match on an item name, having
to match against the 'a ' is a bit non intuitive.  MSW 6/27/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.95.6:

also skills/holysymbol and lockpicks.
skills/tailsman.arc:  added nrof to archetype so these things will join.

---END BATCH UPDATE--- DAMN 9/17/1999

Give power crystal a weight of one.  This allows it to be picked up - msw

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.93.3:

Number of images cleaned up/improved/created by David Sundqvist.

Several new images/archetyps added - new wall types, dedicated altars for
the gods (very nicely looking), and some other changes by David.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.7

Cleaned up the dev directory some - got rid of a bunch of files that have
since been merged.  Also, got rid of things that should no longer be
applicable (via code changes), and stuff in which there was only and archetype
object - there should be enough examples out there on how to create new
archetyps.

Weight for some monsters updated to be in more in line with what should be
expected.

Editable cleaned up for a bunch of objects.

Half orc and halfling player types added.

Some archetyps for throwing added

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Crossfire 0.92.6

Several objects added for Brian Thomas valley quest maps - some disabled
archetypes moved back into palce.

Changes for Crossfire 0.92.5

Many archetypes added for the kunji maps.

Changes for Crossfire 0.91.7

Many new archetypes added by Brian Thomas (thomas@nomad.astro.psu.edu).
These are spread out in many different directories.

Spectres are no longer animated.  In this way, invisibilty on them works
properly.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.5:

Changed editable value in some items so they appear in the proper
place for crossedit.

Moved all files in the 'item' directory into misc.

Changes for Crossfire 0.90.4:

Added DarkOrange to xpm.template file.  Before, there were only
two oranges, and the dark orange was closer to a brown.

Cleaned up some of the X Pixmaps.  Eliminated some colors from the
various files that are not in the official xpm.template file.

Merged the soda archetypes in.  Like Chico, they were at least
partially colored as I transfered them.

Tried to clean up the directories some.  All spell effects should
now be in magic, where as items that are related to spells (wands,
books, horns, rods, etc) are in spells.  Either item or misc should
be removed, as the stuff in them seems like it could be placed
in the other directory.

Changes for crossfire 0.90.3:
Merged chico archetypes in their proper location, instead of being
in a separate directly.  Colored them as I went.
