Story behind my Island

The human king of the mainland has explorers scout for new territory.

On one expedition to an island, the explorers found some flecks of gold in the river they settled next to.

Upon notification of this, the king ordered a permanent colony be established there, in order to find and harvest the gold.

A while after the colony was built, they found out an ancient fire dragon lives in a dormant volcano on the island.

It was very dangerous, and attacked often, so one night when it was in the volcano, the colony had some mages seal it in
using powerful runes.

They runes will eventually wear off though, so there needs to be a more permanent solution.

Thats where the player comes in.  You arrive in the port of the colony, ready to start your adventure.

The king, however, wont just let anyone open the seal and try to kill the dragon.

First you have to prove you are powerful enough, through a series of increasingly difficult quests.
