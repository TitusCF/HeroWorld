            Normally, monsters are affected by the mood floor as soon as they
            step on it. But charming (monster -&gt; pet) is too powerful, so it
            needs to be activated.

            Typically it is connected to an altar, for buying a "hireling". But
            a powerful pet could as well be the reward for solving a quest. Or
            even better: It could be *part* of a quest!</td>
