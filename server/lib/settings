# Character creation values.
# The min, max, and points values are used for new (in client)
# creation method - this determines those values as one would expect.
# Note - the order here is relevant as the server has built in defaults
# it will use, and it ensures that all the values are reasonable - thus
# if one increase the points value to 140 before increasing the max value,
# it will generate an error.
#
# the roll_stat_points is used for the legacy system where stats are rolled
# up.
# The reason for that difference is with the new client method, the player
# can choose their stat points, so even with 84 points, they could generate
# a character with 3 18 stats (it would mean the remaining stats average
# 7.5) - with the roll method, it is very unlikely to generate such
# characters, so if the same number of stat points were given, while
# the characters total stats would be higher, the character itself
# would likely be worse.

# This defines how much of a player's experience should be 'permanent' and
