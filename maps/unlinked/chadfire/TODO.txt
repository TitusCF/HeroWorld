Short (and likely incomplete) list of items on the TODO list, in no particular order:

* Run all maps through the map editor normalizer
* Test all map exits and entrances to make sure they work
* Audit all maps for over powered items
* Replace custom items, where necessary, with items from archetypes (create new archetypes where appropriate)
* Find out where there are copies of the Nexus and HallOfSelection maps in this patch
* Check maps for balance issues
* Play test maps
* Any other corrections or updates
* Arrange maps in to directory structure such as /shops, /temples, /houses, etc.

After the above is complete...
* Deploy the maps available in the existing world map setting
