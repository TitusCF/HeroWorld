# Private transport

A private transport is a transport you can make yours.

I think I'll be using the word "personal" when facing the players (a
"personal ship" sounds a bit more pleasant than a "private ship")


# Features of private transports

Private transports come featureless.

You can buy scrolls, like the "Add Cabin To Ship", to add new features to
your transport.


# History of Name

This section was originally named "Private Ships" (therefore the name of
the directory). However, as the feature may be used by more objects than
just ships (for example, you can have personal dragons or personal
ships), I decided to rename it to "Private Transports".

private_ship is still the name of the directory because I don't want to
break anything.
