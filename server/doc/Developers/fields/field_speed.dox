            the detector to behave almost like pedestals/buttons, set speed
            rather high, like &lt;detection speed&gt; 1.0.</td>

                will "move", thus how fast the symptoms strike the host.</td>

@ref page_type_62
		</td><td>            The &lt;casting speed&gt; defines the spell-casting speed of the
            wall. You can fine-tune how long the duration between two casts
            shall be. If you want to create a wall that can be activated (cast
            per trigger) via connected lever/button/etc, you must set "speed 0".</td>

		<td>
@ref page_type_55
		</td><td>            The &lt;marking speed&gt; defines how quickly it will mark something
            standing on the marker. Set this value rather high to make sure the
            player really gets his mark. I think &lt;marking speed&gt; 1.0
            should do fine.</td>

            fight. High &lt;speed&gt; makes a monster considerably stronger.</td>

@ref page_type_40
		</td><td>            The movement speed value determines how fast a chain of these movers
            will push a player along (default is -0.2).</td>

		<td>
@ref page_type_138
		</td><td>            The higher the &lt;drowning speed&gt;, the faster will players and
            items sink into the swamp. Swamp with very high &lt;drowning speed&gt;
            can be a nasty and unexpected death-trap. Players should get a
            warning before such areas.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_41
		</td><td>            If the &lt;activation speed&gt; is nonzero, the teleporter will
            automatically be activated in regular time-intervals. Hence, the
            player can just step on it and gets teleported sooner or later. The
            duration between two activates depends on the given value. Default
            in the teleporter arch is &lt;activation speed&gt; 0.1.

            VERY IMPORTANT: If you want to have your teleporter activated via
            button/handle/magic_ear/etc, you must set &lt;activation speed&gt;
            to zero!</td>
