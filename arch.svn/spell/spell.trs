# this is really used for wonder - need a source of
# all spells it should cast - currently, just take all
# that show up in books.  This should probably be reworked
# to be more selective, so wonder could at least be considered
# somewhat useful - maybe toss in some spell that are quest items
# even to make things interesting.
