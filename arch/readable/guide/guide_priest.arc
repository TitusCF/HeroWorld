o If you plan to utilize divine powers you
  must first choose a cult. Enter a temple
  of the cult you want to join. Step onto
  the altar and pray (type "use_skill
  praying"). The divine spirit will touch
  your soul, attuning your mortal being
  to your god.
o Next you must learn prayers. Prayer books
  can be bought in magic shops. Some prayers
  will have different effects for every cult.
  Try to find "holy word" and "bless".
o Casting divine spells (= prayers) will drain
  grace. When it runs low, pray to renew your
  faith. If your maximum grace is too low
  you should try to increase your Wisdom stat.
o You can change cults anytime, but beware:
  Your former deity will become very angry and
  punish you! You might lose wisdom levels.
o Return to the temple of your cult regularly.
  Step onto the altar and pray. This will
  please your deity... And rest assured, the 
  gods do know how to reward a worthy disciple!
o Never lose your faith! Rumors tell about
  divine spells of incredible power, and of
  old, wise priests that have almost reached
  immortality...
