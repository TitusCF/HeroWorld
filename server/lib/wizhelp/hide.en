hide:

This hides the DM from being seen by other players. This is done by making the player perpetually invisible. It also results in the player not showing up in the who command, maps command, or being reported as a player on the metaserver.

Note that the DM can still do things that makes his presence known, e.g., shout, other DM actions, etc.
