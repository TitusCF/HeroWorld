This directory is the proper directory for all python scripts for crossfire and the default location for importing CF modules.

The subdirectories are:

/: all shared files
/events: all script files called by a global server event
/items: all scripts embedded in archetypes
/IPO: all scripts relating to the Imperial Post and Bank system
/guilds: all scripts relating to guild management
/casino: all scripts related to the casino
/misc: other scripts

Script additions should be placed in a subdirectory, either existing, or when it makes sense, a new one.
Shared classes used for import should be placed in the root directory

All Python scripts added to this map repository should be tested with and valid for Python 2.3
