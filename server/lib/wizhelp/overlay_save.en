Syntax: overlay_save

This will save everything on the current map that was not originally part of it as an overlay. The overlay will then be loaded anytime the map itself is loaded. Be careful with this as EVERYTHING on the map will be saved in an overlay, such as spawned monsters and dropped objects.
