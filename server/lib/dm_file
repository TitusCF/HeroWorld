# This file contains authorization for dm access.  There are 3 fields, like
# this:  name:password:host
# Any field can be ignored if a * is used instead of a normal value - this
# is the extent of the wildcarding.
#
# Lines that start with # are obviously ignored.  This file is read each time
# someone attempts to become dm, so it can be changed after the server is
# running and results will apply to the present server that is running.
#
# Example entries:
# master:topsecret:*	(name must be master, password is topsecret, allow any
#	 host
# *:notelling:*		(only matches password)
#
# It is pretty easy - you should be able to figure it out with few problems
