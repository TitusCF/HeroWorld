name Saving and Exiting
msg
A bed of reality is used for saving your game. Whenever you want to leave the game,
or just save in a particular town, apply (press space) on a bed of reality,
like the one at the end of this hallway, and then answer the question of wether you want
to continue playing. To log out, you of course have to answer negatively to that question.
The next time you login, your player will start from that bed's location, with all the inventory
items you had when you logged out. Also, if your player ever dies, you will be returned to the
location of the last bed of reality you used. If you leave without using a savebed your character's
body will stay in the dungeon unconsciously and will be prey to monsters and other hazards, so
always use a bed of reality for leaving the game.
You may use this one now, and then continue on after logging back in.

Congratulations, you have completed this part of the tutorial!
Take the exit to your east to move on.
Step carefully around the gravestone of Harold, who didn't pay very close attention and paid the price. :-)

name Potions
msg
Potions can help you in many ways, boosting your stats temporarily or permanently,
giving you resistance to certain attacks, or healing you. Save this potion of healing
for some time when you are injured and unable to retreat to heal slowly.
Keep in mind that potions you find can be cursed just like other objects, so always
get them identified before using them.

name Shops
msg
Shops are an important part of Deliantra. Shops will sell you all sorts of adventuring supplies,
and then buy almost any treasure you bring back to sell.
To enter a shop, step on the shop mat. This will transport you to the inside. 
To exit, simply step on the inside mat. To sell items, drop them on the shop floor.
To buy items, simply pick up what you want and leave. The cost of the items will
be taken from your inventory. If you don't have enough money to pay your bill, you
won't be allowed to leave, and you will have to drop enough of the items you picked
up until you can afford what you're holding.
You may enter this shop and look around, and buy something if you have the money.
When you're in the shop, clicking on an item in your inventory will tell you how much
the shop will pay you for it. Standing over an item on the shop floor and examining it
(read the tooltip when hovering over it or press B<Left-Alt-e>).
WARNING: Be very careful not to drop anything you aren't sure you want to sell!
Once dropped, an item is sold and belongs to the shop, and the price for buying
it back may be many times what you sold it for. Check your client's documentation
on "locking" items for instructions on how to lock your important items so you can't
accidentally drop them.

Some monsters, like mice, can multiply without a generator (after all, they are mice).
If not killed quickly, these monsters can spread to fill up a map completely.
Run through this door and kill the mice inside before they get out of control (to be honest, we cheated
and tried our best to keep them from spreading throughout the whole map, but once
outside int he harsh world, you will not be as lucky).

Magic scrolls like the one to your south contain one spell each.
When you read a magic scroll, the spell is cast and the scroll crumbles into dust.
Take this scroll and save it for some time when you have collected a bunch of
items and want to cast detect magic on them.

Tables work much like altars. The table to the
east is an I<identify item> table. It will identify the
unidentified items in your inventory, one at a time, for 20
gold pieces each. Tables are often found in shops
too, especially magic shops.

This altar to your east is a I<detect curse> altar.
It works the same as the I<detect magic> altar below.
Altars like these are often found in shops in towns.  
Always detect curse on items you find before applying them.
If you apply a cursed item, you won't be able to remove it until the curse is removed.

=== Altars ===
Altars have many different uses.  Some altars are consecrated to a particular god.
Do not pray over these altars unless you wish to worship that god! (More on gods later).
Altars can also cast spells and perform other actions if you place the correct sacrifice on them.
The altar to your east is an I<altar of detect magic>. Dropping money on it will cause it to cast
detect magic on all the items in your inventory.  (Make sure you pick up your change). 
To drop money, right-click on it in your inventory while standing on the altar. If you want to be careful
you can select the B<drop n> option from the item popup menu and only drop a few coins.
Magic items are often worth more than identical non-magic items, so detect magic can
help you decide which ones to sell and which ones to identify or keep.

msg
Ready your bow, crossbow or rod by clicking on it. Arrows or bolts in your inventory will be used automatically.
If you want to use a spell you learned (you might check your inventory for any spellbooks and read them
by applying them), use the B<cast name of spell> command, as in B<cast burning hands> or simply
B<cbh>, which will put the spell into your range slots, just as with a bow or crossbow.
To fire a missile weapon (or in general make a ranged attack), hold down your B<Shift> key (the "fire" key),
and press the movement key in the direction you want to fire, for example B<Shift-Right>. If you recall how
you disarmed traps earlier, you will see its the same: first you ready your weapon/spell/skill, then you fire it
with B<Shift>.
On the other side of these doors are some monsters.
Pull the lever to open the doors, and shoot them all!
Don't worry, there's a force preventing them from reaching you.
Continue down the passageway until you get back to this hallway, then go north.

Welcome to Deliantra!
You are now in the beginner's area, which will
teach you the fundamentals of playing Deliantra,
and prepare you to survive in this vast and
sometimes dangerous world.
As you pass through these halls, read all the
signs and any other information provided, and
you'll soon learn the basics of the game.
From here, move south (press your B<down-arrow> key)
and press the space bar to read the next sign. Good luck!

=== Commands ===
There are many commands you can use to
do everything from movement to attacking
to casting spells to identifying treasure.  Any
command in Deliantra can be executed by
simply typing it in and pressing B<Space>+B<Return>.
So to move southeast, for example, you could type
B<< southeast <return> >>. To read this sign, you could type
B<< apply sign <return> >>. These "long-form" commands are
always available for everything you can do in
the game.
However, it would be cumbersome to type
commands like that for common actions, so
many commands are bound to keys by default.
You can also enter commands by typing their initials. For example,
instead of typing B<< southeast <return> >>, you can type B<< se<return> >> (note the lack of the space).
Instead of typing B<cast summon pet monster> you can usually type B<cspm> and so on.
You can also create your own keybindings, for example to use spells, items or skills. To do that, you
can usually use the popup menu you get when pressing the B<right mouse button> over an item
and select the B<bind ...> option.

=== Movement ===
You can move in any of eight directions: north,
south, east, west, and the four in between.
Pressing a movement key once (or executing a
movement command) will move you one tile
in that direction. If something is in the way, your
character might attack it.
To run in a direction, which is very useful when
fighting, battering down doors, or traveling long
distances, hold down the B<Ctrl> key and press
and hold the key for direction you wish to run.
The four primary directions are bound to the arrow/cursor keys,
and all eight directions including diagonals on the numeric keypad. For laptop users
without numeric keypads you can also use B<Alt>-arrow key to get a diagonal movement.
Now run to the end of this hallway (by pressing and holding B<Ctrl-Right-Arrow>), and read
the sign there.

Chests and other containers are often protected by traps.
To find and disarm these traps, stand on the chest or next to it while
using the find traps and disarm traps skills.
Once you think a chest is safe, open it by applying it with the space bar,
and see what's inside.
Sometimes you won't be able to find a trap, or it will be triggered when you try to disarm it.
That's just the risk you take in the pursuit of treasure! If you get hurt by a trap, let yourself
heal before you move on, in case you walk into another one.

name Talking to NPCs
msg
=== Talking to People ===
There are two different types of "people" in the game: PCs (player characters, i.e. other players)
and NPCs (non-player-characters, your typical dumb computer-automated pseudo persons :)
To talk to other players, for example to get help, you can use the B<chat> command, whose text
is displayed in the B<Chat> tab. All players currently logged in can see that. You can simply type
B<c some message>+<return> to chat with others without activating the Chat tab. There is also the B<shout>
command (short "sh") for use in emergencies, and B<say> (short "s") which all players on a map and all
NPCs near you can hear.
You can also get information from non-player characters (NPCs) in the game by talking to them.
NPCs that can talk to you have a little speech bubble sign in the upper left corner of their map space.
To talk to the man at the end of this hallway when you're finished reading this,
walk up next to him and left-click on him with your mouse.
Clicking on NPCs lets you use a dialog window to communicate with the NPC. The say
command is more tedious, but works when you can't see the NPC, or you need to say a password.
Many NPC have useful information, but they will only tell you about it if you ask the
right questions. If the NPC talks to you, look for words in his reply
that might be important (often they are underlined), and ask about them.
For example, if he says, "Hello, do you have any food?" ask him about food,
and he may say something else in response to that.
Saying words like quest, key, treasure, and other things you're interested in may
start up very interesting conversations!
Be careful not to run into friendly NPCs: dead men tell no tales.
Now go talk to that old man.
If you run into problems or want to skip this part of the tutorial, use the B<say open> command.

See that rune to the north?  You may have to
wait a few seconds to see it as it will not be visible all the time.

If you have the find traps and disarm traps skills mentioned earlier, you can step NEXT to
it and attempt to find and disarm it. Since it's at the end of the hallway, you might decide it's
not worth the risk, since there's nothing beyond it, but it's good to increase your experience
in those skills whenever possible.
Remember: to search for traps, press B<Left-Alt-s> (or use the B<ready_skill find traps> = B<rsft> command)
to ready your find traps skill, and fire (Shift-direction key) in the direction you want to search.
To attempt to disarm any traps you find, press B<Left-Alt-d> (or type B<ready_skill disarm traps>)

How did you do?  Watch your hit points (HP)
closely during battle. They are displayed in the lower right area of your client, and also as a horizontal bar above your character when you are injured.
If they get too low, you can always retreat and come back. Hit points
gradually regenerate over time, so if you took
damage, wait until your HP is back to the
maximum before moving on. Eating food
is vital for HP regeneration, so you may want
to eat this food now.

=== Doors ===
There are many kinds of doors in Deliantra.
Some doors will open for you, so you can walk
right through. Ordinary locked doors can be
bashed open by attacking them or using
lockpicks. Stronger locked doors may require
a certain key, or open when you speak a magic
word or activate a certain trigger somewhere.
To get through this first door, run into it until
you break through. If you are too weak it might take a long time.
Either be persistent or create a new character with a higher Strength stat.

name Triggering Buttons with Weights
msg
Sometimes large buttons in the floor can
be activated by a large weight.  Run into this
boulder (B<Ctrl-Left>) to push it onto the button to your
west, and see what happens.
Boulders and other "rollable" items like barrels can only be pushed,
never pulled, so be careful not to push them into corners from where
you won't be able to move them to their destination.
If you are very weak you may have to try a lot of times to move the boulder. Do not give up! Even
weak characters can push things if they are persistent.

Cool, huh! Buttons and other switches can be
used to do all sorts of things, sometimes on
completely different areas of a map, so if you
ever think you're stuck, look around for any
of these kinds of triggers that might open
a way out for you.

A magic voice says:
Here is a note you can pick up and take with you.  (You may have already picked it up
automatically if your client is set to do that.  If so, find it in your inventory and read it by
clicking with the middle mouse button or scroll wheel).  You may wish
to read it first (press B<space> to apply it), and then pick it up (press the B<comma> key or use the B<take> command).
Now it will be in your inventory, so you can read it anytime you need to.

name Gathering Information
msg
=== Information ===
There are many sources of information other
than signs like this one. Did you see the sign
on the wall as you were running here?
Sometimes information comes from non-visible
sources like that, so always keep your eyes
open and don't miss anything that shows up
in your B<Messages> window.
Information also comes from books, notes, and
many other sources. The smallest note can be
the first clue to a large treasure or heroic quest,
so always gather as much information as possible.
Some notes and books you will be able to pick
up and take with you, while others will be
fixed where they are, but they all may be
important to read.
It is possible for your character to be unable to read
such notes. If that is the case and your INT stat is high enough
you cna later learn to read by learning the literacy skill.

Some walls, called "earthwalls," are soft and can be battered down and destroyed.
Run at the wall to your east until you pass through.
If you are very weak you might need a long time time to destroy the earthwall. Do

name Traps, and Automatic Doors
msg
By the way, it's a good idea to always check
for traps before trying to open a door. Do
this with the command B<ready_skill find traps> (short B<rsft>, by default
bound to the B<Left-Alt-s> key) and then keep firing into the
direction where you want to search for traps (by pressing and holding B<Shift> + a direction key, here
B<Shift-Right-Arrow>).
If you find a trap the server will tell you so and the trap will become visible, you can try to disarm it with
B<ready_skill disarm traps> (short B<rsdt>, bound to B<Left-Alt-d>) and again firing
into the direction of the trap you found.
You can only find and disable traps if you have those skills. If you don't, you should
learn them early.
Some doors will open when you walk up to them,
then close after a moment.  Be careful not to
get crushed by standing in the doorway
too long!

Other kinds of walls can also have weak spots.
Look for cracks in the wall, especially if you
hear voices or have reason to think there might
be secret areas nearby.
Sometimes walls are illusions that can be walked
through. Go south from here.

name Inventory
msg
=== Inventory ===
Stop and take a look at your inventory for a moment.  If you started the game with any
armor or a hand-to-hand weapon like a sword, you probably should ready them now.
You can toggle the inventory on and off by opening the playerbook with the B<Tab> key (or
directly going to the inventory with the B<F5> key. The popup menu you get when right-clicking on the
map (not the minimap) will tell you about these keys).
You wield/ready (and unwield/unready) weapons and other items by applying them. To do so,
click on the item with your middle mouse button (or scroll wheel button).
Don't make the mistake of many new players, and run into your first monsters naked and empty-handed. :-)

=== Fighting ===
Ready for your first fight?  On the other side
of this door are some ants. They're mostly
harmless, so run into them as fast as you can,
until you kill them. Be sure to kill the anthill
too, so it can't produce more ants. Many
monsters have "generators" like this which
produce more monsters every so often.
After you kill the ants, go through the next
door.
