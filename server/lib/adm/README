This directory contains various scripts and utilities.  This file attempts
to describe them:

dilate_xpm_files: Try to figure out what pixels on a xpm file should be
transparent, and then makes the changes.

fix_xpm_colors:  Takes and .arc file, and converts all black and
white xpm files that archetype uses to color xpm files, using the colors
in the archetype description.

dilate_xpm_files and fix_xpm_colors should no longer be needed - all the old
bitmaps have been converted to XPM images, and any new ones should be
created in XPM mode to better use multiple colors.

map_info: (From Tero Haatanen <Tero.Haatanen@lut.fi>).  It goes through
the map files in the specified directory, printing out problems and
also generating a list of used objects.

map_check:  Another program that goes through and checks maps.  This one
starts at the starting map, and then visits all the maps connected to it,
and so on.  Thus, its output and the output of do a 'find . -type f -print'
in the maps directory, can be compared after some modification, to find maps
in the map directory that are not connected to anything.  I think that
map_info does a better job about other map errors, however.

getfaces: Reads an archetype tree and outputs as list of faces used by
objects that fit certain criteria. It has many options so be sure to check
it's usage.
