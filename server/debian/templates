_Description: Move files and directories to /var/games/crossfire?
 Beginning from version 1.0.0, all game runtime generated files are kept in
 /var/games/crossfire. Looks like you had the old package installed, and files
 need to be moved from /var/lib/games/crossfire into /var/games/crossfire.
 Do you want to do this? If you prefer to do this by yourself, just answer
 negatively here.
