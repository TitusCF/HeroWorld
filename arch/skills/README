This directory contains the different skills available.

The Skill_Tools directory contains devices which enable a skill
to be used, or perhaps makes the user better at the skill.
Note that some number of skill tools are located with the
player/class diretories.

See the doc/Developers/skills for more information on what
the values here mean.  The file has details on what it takes 
to add a new skill to the game.
