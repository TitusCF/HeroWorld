                in all sorts of things (spell-casting, praying,...). Unless the
                &lt;luck bonus&gt; is very high, the effect will be barely
                visible in-game. Luck bonus on one piece of equipment should
                never exceed 3, and such bonus should not be too frequently
                available.</td>
