Description:
Gnomes and dwarves look so much alike that some speculate that they are the same race, but with very different cultures. No one has been able to talk a Dwarf and a Gnome into attempting interbreeding, however, which would settle the issue. Dwarves and gnomes have a disgust for one another and both find the thought of intimacy with the other repulsive. Despite that, they coexist peacefully enough: perhaps because their interests and needs never conflict.
Gnomes do not have nearly the strength or hardiness of dwarves, and they are even more clumsy. They are quite spiritual, and make very good priests, and many are very strong magicians. They can see in the dark, and their familiarity with the gods seems to bring a general blessing of good luck on all Gnomekind.
