This directory includes some scripts I wrote to update various archetypes
with certain new values.

These scripts were written to get the job done - they are certainly not
in the best style.  In many cases, the same script was modified for a new
purpose, so the variable names reflect the individual script purpose.

Most all of them take a list of files to work on.  You can typically
do something like script.pl *.arc */*.arc */*/*.arc, etc to update
a large number of files at once.

update_armor.pl: Replaces the last_heal variables with gen_sp_armour.
Note that this doesn't look at object type, and just does a straight
replacement, so should only be run against armor .arc files.

update_body.pl: Adds appropriate body_.. to equipment objects.  It
looks at the type of equipment it is to determine what body locations
to add.

update_monster.pl: Looks at the various can_use... flags and forms
body information for the object.

update_object.pl: Used to add the name_pl and client_type fields to
the objects.  The first parameter to this script is the client
type to set to, the rest of the parameters are the files to operate on.

update_shield.pl: add can_use_shield values to players/monsters.
Basically, it takes the value of can_use_armor and duplicates it for
can_use_shield.  Doesn't care about object type.

updatearch: This is a shell script which is a bit different - basically,
you provide a perl expression as its parameter, and it runs this
against all the .arc files in the directory you run it in - example:
updatearch 's/armor/prot_phys/' will make the substitution.
