o There are four separate magic skills: evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning. Each skill allows a different set of spells to be learned and used.
o To advance in the powerful art of magic you must first learn some spells. Spellbooks can be bought in magic stores.
o Spellcasting will drain your mana. If you run low drink a "magic power potion" if you can afford it. Extremely helpful are items that speed up your mana-regeneration. Don't expect to find them easily though!
o Try to increase your Pow stat. by wearing rings and drinking "potions of power". This will boost your max. amount of mana.
o All spells are classified in certain spell-paths. Most of them divide up into one of the elemental paths: fire, cold and electricity. Search for items granting attunement to these spell-paths. This will reduce the mana-cost for affected spells. Sometimes it can have other positive effects as well.
o Most monsters are vulnerable to certain elemental (and other) attacks. Try to figure out what spells work best for each type of monster. This will increase your efficiency.
o Your magic attacks might soon become very powerful. But don't forget to seize your full capabilities: use spells for protection, concealing, summoning... be inventive!
