Patch #281 chad's unfinished island maps

I'm making these available because I'm sort of taking a break from working on these right now. So anyone can 
take a stab at making something of this island if they want (right now its basically a decently functional 
world setup, except with the whole giant wilderness empty without dungeons...but the towns are mostly fine).

Its hard to figure out how to go about putting in dungeons in the wilderness, and monsters themselves...too 
many breeds disease too easy, too little is boring, too randomly is weird, non-randomly is complicated...etc

And then I was thinking of trying to make a technically linear world setup like how pokemon or fable is, 
but some 'goto' issues sort of paused that idea.

So for now im taking a break, theres the files if anyone wants to try anything...
