Files:

   town/
      portjoseph:  This is the center of all of the quests associated
with these files.  It is the only map that hooks in with outside
maps.   To hook in with portjoseph the destination should be set 
to /langley/town/portjoseph x:10 y:21 The only exit from port joseph 
is currently set to arrive at the third ship from the left on the 
docks in Scorn.  (set to /city/city x:19, y:4)
      church, churchtower, churchcrypt:  These three
files form a small dungeon for slightly experienced adventurers
(yet another undead church)
      inn, generalstore:  The standard town fare.
      dshark:  The beginning of the pirates quest (and other
quests in the future, I hope)
      portia, portia2: part two of the pirate quest. 
      percy:  This map  is a ghost duplicate of the  portjoseph
map docks, with the addition of a pirate.  It hooks in directly
with the pirate quest and will also take characters to newby
land: goblin isle (under construction, not included here.)
