1)
Create a command which allows players to leave their cult without
needing to join another. There will be a penalty equal to the penalty
associated with changing cults.

2)
Expand 'Consecrate' spell so that when it is cast by a player who belongs
to no cult, he is given the option to consecrate that altar to himself.
This has the effect of generating a 'Cult of PLAYER NAME' and turning that altar
into the first altar for that religion.
Before the player(you)is able to step off the altar being consecrated, you are prompted
with a series of options related to the specific buffs of your cult:
You are prompted to select two general stats and either four resistance stats
OR three resisances and one special to be the buffs related to your new cult.
After making this selection you are free to step off your new altar.
Consecration of blank altars by you or members of your cult will result in creating more
altars associated with your cult.

As a demigod, your general stat cap will increase to 60 and special stats will become uncapped.
You will recieve a percentage buff to the stats you selected which is determined your natural
statistic + a percentage determined by the average level of followers you are able to attract 
to your cult.

Avg Lvl: 0-1  =  -10% buff
	2-5 =   2% buff
	5-10 =  5%
	10-20 = 10%
	20-30 = 15%
	30-40 = 25
	40-50 = 30
	50-60 = 35%
	60-70 = 40%
	70-80 = 45%
	80-90 = 50% 
	90-100 = 55%
	100-115 = 60%
	CAP UNTIL TESTING SUGGESTS OTHERWISE

Followers will recieve a buff to stats selected during cult generation that is calculated
as 10% of those stats on the demigod player and limited by standard PC caps. This value is expected
to increase or decrease with the Demigod players activity.
Statistic modifications demi-god players recieve from gear is considered during this process.
Cult members are expected to recieve feedback as their buffs increase or decrease.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cult Spells:

At any time a Demigod player is able to cast a spell or prayer over one of their own altar,
this will prompt the game to ask if the would like that spell to be the spell or prayer
available to suffiently powerful cult members.
Perhaps a relationship between the casting level of the demigod to the grace requirement?
Demigods may use this process to change their cults spell as many times as they would like.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Cult Items:

At any time a Demigod player is able to bring an artifact to one of their altars and place it
on the altar. Demigod casts 'Consecrate' which triggers a secondary effect having been cast by
the demigod onto his own consecrated altar.
Game asks player if they would like to destroy this item and make it their cults religious
atifact. If yes, item is destroyed and becomes available as 'God-Given' to sufficiently powerful
members of that cult.
Perhaps a relationship between the item power level and grace level required to recieve the item?
Demigod may use this process to change their cult item as many times as they would like.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardcore Mode + DemiGod:

Demigods who also apply hardcore mode drop a corpse upon their death and their cult enters a
temporary suspension (no new members, cult buffs suspended, all cult items vaporized, all cult spells
deactivated until the corpse can be raised.) 
If corpse is reincarnated, new PC will assume the position held by their precursor 
but will begin as a new Demigod-PC, cult items and spells remain intact. Cult activity will 
return to normal for all members except that the buffs they recieved before reincarnated will 
be decreased. 
If corpse is simply raise_dead, cult activity returns as normal.
