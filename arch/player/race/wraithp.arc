Description:
A Wraith is the spirit of a person who has made an evil bargain in order to persist after natural death, or has been forced involuntarily into its current undead state. This transformation frees them of the limits of a natural lifespan, and grants them immunity to diseases, poison, and loss of lifeforce. Wraiths also need feel little fear of cold, and they can see well in the dark. A Wraith's corporeal form has terrible vulnerabilities: fire and most godpower are dangerous to Wraiths. Their tenuous form makes them quick and somewhat hard to hit, but also weaker and less hardy.
Wraiths have a strong affinity to magic, especially cold spells, and are very strong spellcasters. However, they cannot use fire spells for fear of self-destruction. Wraith also do not heal naturally, or gain sustenance from food. Instead they have to feed off the living.
