*******************************************************************************
1. HOW TO CREATE NEW ARCHETYPES AND BITMAPS:
********************************************************************************
 0) Determine if a new archetype is really needed.  Archetypes are only needed
    to add new images, or if the archetype simplifies creation of a very common
    item.  Don't make a new arch if all you really need to simply customize an
    existing archetype.
 1) Figure out which directory/category the object will belong to.  This
    determines an appropriate location for it inside the 'arch' directory.  For
    objects with many animations or that are very large, a new subdirectory may
    be advisable.
 2) Create a bitmap.  It must be divisible by 32 in both height and width.  The
    file format should be .PNG 256 colour with transparency.
 3) Create additional bitmaps if you want animation or directional facing.
 4) Split the bitmaps up into 32x32 bitmaps and named according to the
    naming.doc conventions in the arch tar package.  Note, this is not really
    necessary at current time - non-split images should work properly, but some
    older clients may have problems with it.  (the script "splitxbm" may be
    used and is included below).
 5) Create an archetype entry.  The file should be called object.arc, where
    object is whatever the new object is.  This is by far the most complicated
    step.  See "crossfire.doc" for an introduction on how to create archetypes.
    Look at other similar archetypes to see how they have been made.  If a
    single 32x32 bitmap is created, only need one archetype is needed, but if a
    larger bitmap is made which is cut down to several 32x32 bitmaps, use
    "linked" archetypes are needed.  To create a linked archetype, add a 'More'
    line filed by the next piece.  The X and Y coordinates in this next piece
    determine the offset from the head (first) object.  When making multipart
    objects, they should be rectangular.  Non rectangular may work, but has not
    been tested.

    Note that for multi-part objects, in most cases, only the values in the
    head portion are used (eg, hp, damage, etc for monsters) so it is generally
    unnecessary to put a copy of all the head tags in the other parts.

    See the section later in this document about animations.

 6) If the archetype is a creature or NPC, and if it has abilities such as
    firebreathing or magical attacks, these abilities are put into the
    treasures file in the appropriate entry, and as invisible objects.  This is
    also how inventory like bows or swords is given.  Look at the other entries
    in the treasures file for the format to use.  Note that if an existing
    entry in the treasures file does what you want, reuse it for the new
    archetype.  There is no requirement that each archetype have a unique
    treasure list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is an archetype and what is an object?

Objects are directly derived from archetypes.  Everything the player
sees in the game is an object.  The player never deals with archetypes.

Archetypes are the master objects.  All objects have an archetype that they
are derived from.  When an object is created, the archetype is used for
all the default values in the object.  When an object is saved, the code
looks at the differences between the archetype and the object it is saving,
and only changes the different values.

Archetypes are the entries in the 'arch' directory.  The fields for
archetypes and objects are generally the same.

Note that by using this archetype model, it means an archetype can get
updated and all objects that are derived from it will get updated -
this is very useful when new fields are added - the archetypes can get
updated, and all objects in maps, player save files, wherever, get
this new value.

It is valid to put items into an archetype, including a customized version. All
objects created from the archetype will include the object(s) (including their
own inventory).

*******************************************************************************
2. Things that are alive
*******************************************************************************

The name in parentheses after a flag description is the name as it should be
used in the archetype file.  For example:  Attack type (attacktype)


A. Attack Types (attacktype)
===============


Attack types   bit		description

Physical	1  		Basic attacktype.
Magic		2  		All magic spells, but not prayers
Fire		4  		Can ignite objects
Electricity	8  		Can also ignite objects
Cold		16  		Can freeze objects into ice cubes
Confusion	32  		Movement/attack directions become random
Acid		64  		Random equipped item gets -1 to magic attribute
Drain		128  		Victim loses 2% exp, attacker gains half of that
Weaponmagic	256  		Direct damage: Special, use with care
Ghosthit	512  		Attacker dissolves (obsolete)
Poison		1024  		Some damage each turn thereafter
Slow	  	2048  		Speed is reduced
Paralyze	4096  		Speed is reduced to zero
Turn undead	8192  		Like Fear, but for undead only
Fear		16384  		Like Turn Undead, but for living only
Cancellation	32768  		Removes magic (+/-) from items
Depletion	65536  		Lose one point from one stat (can be restored)
Death		131072  	Chance of instant death, otherwise nothing
Chaos		262144  	None by itself, uses random other types
Counterspell	524288  	Cancels magic spells
Godpower    	1048576  	Adds relevant god's attacktype
Holy Word   	2097152  	Enemies: X5, Undead: X1 -unless friends, others: none
Blind       	4194304  	Blinds victim

Note that one archetype can have multiple attack types by adding
these values together.  Thus, something with an attacktype of 65
would attack with both acid and physical.

B. Resistances
===========

Creatures can have various resistances.  If a creature has a resistance
value for a particular attacktype of 100, it is said to be immune
to that attacktype.  The amount of resistance directly reduces
damage.  A creature that has 25% resistance to fire only takes 75%
of the damage.  A creature 99% resistant only takes 1% of the damage.

A few notes:  If a creature/object is immune to magic, then it will be
immune to all damage from that attack, even if that attack type contains
more than just magic.

Otherwise, a creature needs to be immune to all attack types in order
to take no damage (thus, a creature that is immune to physical, but
getting hit by a weapon that does physical and fire would take normal
damage).  The attack code goes through all the attacktypes, and
calculates the damage that each will cause.  It uses the highest damage
total that any of these attacktypes will use.

For attacktypes that don't deal physical damage but instead effect
the creature in some way (drain, slow, paralyze, etc), the resistance
in general reduces the effect (duration, amount drained, etc).

C. NPC Movement (attack_movement)
===============

Set the variable attack_movement to one of the below (cut from define.h):
/******************************************************************************/
/* Monster Movements added by kholland@sunlab.cit.cornell.edu                 */

/*                                      -------------------                   */
/*                      attack_movement = 33                                  */

D.Picking up other items (pick_up)
========================

Pick Up specifiers (defined with pick_up)

Nothing 				1
Wealth		 			2
Food					4
Weapon					8
Armour					16
All but those defined			32
All					64

Note also that if can_use_armor, can_use_weapon, can_use_ring,
can_use_range, can_cast_spell, can_use_bow are set, then the creature
will pick up the matching items even if the pick_up element is not
set to pick up those items. Note that if all flags are unset the monster will
not pick up anything regardless of can_xxx flags.

This only applies to monsters.  The player pickup method is much different.


E. Using other objects (will_apply)
======================

specifiers    will apply this
   1    	Handles
   2		Treasure (chests)
   4         	Earthwall (tear down)
   8        	Door      (open) */


F. Treasure lists (randomitems)
=================

 This determines what treasurelist to use for generating the objects
treasures.  For archetypes, the default is none, but for other objects
(like those loaded in maps), it will use the same treasure list as
the archetype it descends from unless otherwise specified.  In the case
of objects, "none" can be be used to make no items generated.

The format of treasurelists is detailed further down in this file.

Treasure lists are also used to give spell and skill abilities to creatures.



G. Monster Flag Usage
=====================

Damage (dam)
======
Damage determines the amount of damage the creature does.  The form this
damage takes it determined by the attacktype the creature has.

When determining damage, a number between 1 and the damage value is
rolled.  Thus, even if you have a +6 damage bonus from strength, magic
weapons, etc, a value of 1 could still be generated.  Thus, even with very
high magical monsters or very high strength monsters, a low damage roll can
result some of the time.

Speed (speed)
=====
Speed.  A speed of 1.0 means it acts every tick, a speed of 0.1
means it acts every 10 ticks.

level (level)
=====

Int (int)
===
gives monsters a modifying to find hidden/invisible creatures.

Pow (pow)
===
If the creature can cast spells, this is how many spell points
are regenerated each move.

Con (con)
===
Monsters regenerate this many hit points each move.  This is each
time the monster has a move (some for Pow).  So two monsters with the
same Con can regenerate at different rates if their speeds are different.

Wis (wis)
===
Determines how close a player needs to be before the creature wakes
up.  This is done as a square, for reasons of speed.  Thus, if the wisdom is
11, any player that moves within the 11x11 square of the monster will wake
the monster up.  If the player has stealth, the size of this square is
reduced in half plus 1.

Spell points (sp)
============
Number of spell points monster starts with

maxsp (maxsp)
=====
Maximum spellpoints for monsters

flying (flying)
======
set flying to 1 if this can fly.

See Invisible (see_invisible)
=============

See in the dark (can_see_in_dark)
===============

Spell reflection (reflect_spell)
================
Very powerful, use carefully

Pass through (can_pass_thru)
============

Kamikaze attacks (one_hit)
================
Creatures with this value set to 1 will dissipate when they attack (like
ghosts).  They dissipate on the first hit, whether it does any damage or not.

Morale (run_away)
======

Use objects (can_use)
===========
What objects the creature can use.  Note that this has largely been
replaced with the body location information (see further down).
The ones that should in general be used are can_use_shield, can_use_weapon,
and can_use_bow.  the others are likely to be obsoleted.

e.g.

can_use_scroll 1
can_use_skill 1
can_use_range 1
can_cast_spell 1
can_use_bow 1
can_use_armour 1
can_use_weapon 1
can_use_ring 1

Resistances (resist_x)
===========
The amount of resistance the object has to certain attack types or
environmental effects.  Use negative numbers to make objects more vulnerable to
the effects.

e.g
resist_fire 60
resist_cold -30



----------------------------
SPECIAL NOTE (IMPORTANT!!!):
-----------------------------
<del>The fields resist_*, armour, wc and dam can be
set in map files to customize monsters.  However, if that monster can
be equipped with items, and actually equips some, these values will
get reset back to those in the clone archetype (normal values.)  Thus,
if you want to put a wizard in that does dam 50, make sure can_use_armour,
and can_use_weapon are set back to 0.  Otherwise, when items are equipped,
all the above fields will be reset to standard values.</Del>

As of 2006-12-09, this shouldn't be the case anymore: server will detect
modified archetypes, and store its values in a temporary archetype structure to
be able to recompute everything.


H. Generators and Creature Spawning
===================================

Generators spawn monsters or other objects.  By default, generators are alive
and visible and can be destroyed like any other monster.

H.1 Generator (generator)

If set, this object is a generator.  Monsters (like mice) can be generators.

H.2 Use Inventory (use_content_on_gen)

If set, the generator will create objects from its inventory.  If the inventory
holds more than one object, one will be randomly selected from the list each
time the generator creates one.  If not set, the ''other_arch'' object will be
used.

H.3 Object to Create (other_arch)

If ''use_content_on_gen'' is not set, the generator will create copies of the
object set in this field.

H.4 Generator Radius (generator_radius)

The generator will spawn objects within this radius of itself.  (Within a
square of radius*2+1 tiles centered on the generator, to be exact.)  If this is
not set, the radius defaults to 1, for legacy behavior.  Setting it to zero
effectively turns off the generator.

H.5 Maximum Number of Objects on Map (generator_max_map)

If this is set, it limits the number of objects the generator will create at
one time.  Only objects on the same map are counted.  If objects are destroyed
or leave the map, the generator will no longer count them and will be able to
replace them.  If the generator is at its limit, the generator will still
remain on the map, it just will not generate anything.

H.6 Generator Name (generator_name)

This value is used by the generator for marking and identifying the objects it
creates, so it can count them to determine whether ''generator_max_map'' has been
met.  This field is only used when ''generator_max_map'' is set.  If
''generator_name'' is not set, the generator defaults to using its ''name'', or
if that is not set, to ''"generator"''.  If multiple generators on the same map
have the same ''generator_name'', they will claim the same monsters.  This is a
feature, not a bug. :-)  It means that you could have four generators in the
corners of a room, each named "four generators" and each with a
''generator_max_map'' of 50, and they would create up to 50 total monsters, but in
different parts of the room, and possibly from different inventory lists.

H.7 Maximum Objects Generator Will Create (generator_limit)

This value limits how many objects the generator will create before it
disappears.  The default is 0 (unlimited), but many of the archetypes now
set this to a non zero value.  Upon creating the last creature, the generator
will be removed from the map.

H.8 Creatures Generated (generator_generated)

This should never be set in archetypes or on maps, but it may sees on
a swapped out map. It is the variable that holds how many monsters
this generator has created - it is only used if generator_limit is set

H.9 Spawn Rate Limiter (maxsp/GENERATE_SPEED)

Normally, the generate makes the monster whenever it gets its action
(speed_left is positive).  This works fine for static generators like
those for orcs which don't do anything but generate monsters.  However,
there are some monsters, like mice and centipedes, that are also generators.
If the speed was set low enough that the rate the generate monsters didn't
overwhelm the map, they would be harmless as monsters.  And if these
creatures generated a new creature each time they got an action, map
would quickly be full.  To limit this, maxsp is used as a limiter
(note within the code, GENERATE_SPEED should always be used to get
this field)

maxsp is basically a random limiter random()%maxsp must be zero for
a creature to be generated.  Thus, if maxsp is 100, each time the monster
moves, there is a 1% chance of a new creature being made.  If maxsp is 20,
each time the monster moves there is a 5% chance.

Making maxsp a higher value reduces the generation rate.

Note - there is a bug here, in that a spellcasting creature can not
be effectively limited for generator rate, since maxsp is used for both
its normal meaning in this case as well as generator limitation.  It is
unlikely that one would want spell casting creature to also be a
generator.



I. NPC's and their life:
=======================

An NPC can have any combination of the following programs (flags):

FLAGS: (They are checked in the following order:)
  - sleep               (will stand still until woken)
  - scared              (will run away)
  - random_movement     (move randomly)
  - friendly            (will attack enemies of the nearest player)
  - unaggressive        (don't attack until attacked)
  - stand_still         (don't ever move)

sleep + (any)           = sleep until woken, then do any of the other things...
neutral + random_movement = move randomly around all the time.
neutral (alone)         = stand still until attacked, then attack and move.
stand_still + (any)     = do anything except moving

In addition it can have run_away set to which percentage of full
hit-points the npc will run away at.

And then there is the NPC features made by Karl Holland  (see attack_movement)

Note that scared creatures will become unafraid at some point, so it
is typically not useful to set this in maps or in archetypes.


J. NPC's Speak out
==================

The message structure in a monster may contain:
@match <key>|<key>[...]
[@reply value message] (multiple possible)
[@question value message] (multiple possible)
  [text]
[...]

This identifies what the monster will say if talked to with a text that matches
any keys.  They keys are processed as primitive regular expressions, so some
characters act as match operators or metacharacters.  The asterisk, caret,
square braces, and dollar characters are useful to some degree.

The '@reply' and '@question' lines will be sent to the client so the player knows available replies.
The 'value' is a text that should correspond to a @match, and 'message' is what the player
will actually say when saying the 'value'. If using '@reply', the server will display 'player replies: message',
with '@question' it will be 'player asks: message'.
Note that the order of @reply and @question is non significant, they can be mixed, and can probably be
in the middle of the message's text (though easier to put'em at top).
Also, 'value' can't contain spaces.

An example of usage:

@match hello|hi
Welcome, good friend!
@match bye
Goodbye!
@match sss
@reply yes Yes, isn't it a shame?
@question no No, why?
Whasssamatter?  You got a lisssp or sssomething?
@match yes
Sssorry, me too.
@match ^no$
You're lucky!
@match *
What did you sssay?

a. Wildcard Character

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   BUG ALERT!!!  A key containing only '*' will match anything, but it is not
                 handled in the same way that regular expressions are normally
                 handled!  This can only be considered erroneous behavior.  The
                 following paragraphs in this section shall not be construed to
                 be an acceptable design for the server.  For immediate best
                 results, do not use the wildcard character except in the form
                 '@match *' to avoid setting up conversations that do not
                 function correctly.  On the other hand, do use it in expected
                 regular notation form, and do fix the server code bug.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a message does not contain an '@match *', then the first key that contains
an asterisk will be treated as though the key was '*'.  In the example below,
if the player says anything, the NPC will say 'Nice tune...' no matter what the
player says, even if it does not end with 'bug'.  It will not be possible for
the NPC to say 'Bah, humbug to you!'.

@match hum*
Nice tune...
@match *bug
Bah, humbug to you!

Avoid using '*' except in the form '@match *'.  If the above conversation were
amended to also contain a '@match *', neither the 'hum*' nor the '*bug' keys
would work.

In fact, '*' is not needed as used in the above examples since '@match sss'
operates the same way as '@match *sss*' would be expected to operate in a
regular expression.  Because of this, be especially careful with short word
matches like yes/no answers to questions.  '@match yes' triggers when the
player enters any word with 'yes' in it!  If a conversation contains the word
'yesterday' or 'nobody', the player might type one of these words and the NPC
might think they said 'yes' or 'no'.

b. Word Boundaries

If you want to prevent a match string from matching partial words, use the '^'
and '$' metacharacters to bound the word.  In the first example, the NPC only
responds when the player says 'no', and not when the player says any other
word that contains 'no'.

c. Case Insensitivity

Keys need not contain case variations even though old maps often did.  For
example, '@match hello' works just as well as the more verbose versions like
'@match Hello|hello' and '@match "[Hh]ello'.  The matches are done after both
the match list and the player text are converted to lowercase.

d. Multiple Choice

The square braces may be used to construct special matches.  For example, a
key of '[jy]ello' would match 'jello' or even 'yellow'.

e. Quest support

As a special case, if the line just after match is 'quest xxx', then
the NPC will only display the text (without the quote line) if the player
is currently doing indicated quest. See also 'quests' document.

Obviously this feature can be expanded extensively, so expect it
to evolve till the next version.

f. Other Considerations

You might not want to put messages into archetype creatures, this feature is
more for making special NPCs for maps.  However, certain generic messages in
archetypes might add to the general game ambiance a bit (by default: dogs
would say "arf arf" guards would say "move along"...) - tm

******************************************************************************
3. Objects in general
******************************************************************************

The name in parentheses after a flag description is the name as it should be
used in the archetype file.  For example:  type field (type)

A. Names (name, name_pl)
========================

If no 'name' field is specified in the object, it will use the name from
the 'Object' field.

The 'name_pl' field is the plural name for the object.  This only needs
to be set if there is the potential for the object to merge with others -
for example, there is no reason for name_pl to be set for floors, buildings,
etc, as they can not merge with other objects.  Only objects that can
be picked up really need a name_pl value.

If name_pl is not set, this name defaults to the object->name value,
which was either explicitly set or determined from the Object field.

These name values are what the player sees for the name.  As the player
sees it, the name may have the title appended to it, and may also
have other per type specific information added in (spell contained
within the spellbook for example).



B. Types (type) & Subtypes (subtype)
====================================

Specified in defines.h, the type field determines how an item operates/what it
does.

A type only needs to be added for a new archetype if it is actually used in
some part of the program.  Addition of new types is generally a rare event.
For example, if adding a new monster, there is no need to add a new type
in defines.h if the crossfire-server never checks the type element in the
object structure for that new type.

Most types are set for items that are applied, items that have special
properties.

You should look at the include/defines.h file for the latest type information.
When making a map, you should almost never change the type field of an object -
instead, you should start with an object of an appropriate type and change the
fields of the object to appear as you want it to.

http://wiki.metalforge.net/doku.php/dev:object_types contains a wiki version of
the defines.h type definitions.

Subtypes are related to types, in that it narrows down the scope of the
type of object.  For example, the type may be the value for skill,
with subtype being the different skill it uses.  Or for spell objects,
subtype could be the spell identifier.

Subtype is a new field as of April 2003.  It's use needs to be extended.
As example of this is with all equipment items - they should get moved
to be of type 'equipment', with subtype specifying exactly what it does
(ring, helm, armor, etc).

Note that the meaning of the subtype is specific to the type itself - they are
not unique across all types.  For example, for type equipment, subtype 1 might
be a helm.  But for type skills, subtype 1 might be smithery.  One should not
rely on subtype to convey any meaningful information unless the type of the
object is known or also examined.

The question may then be asked - when making a new arch, when is a new type
needed as opposed to a new subtype?

When to add a new type:
1) If code to support applying the object is completely different than
   what exists in apply.c (eg, not reusing existing functions), or
2) If code to support movement of the type does not reuse existing
   functions (server/time.c)

When to make a new subtype:
1) New behavior is _close_ to that of an existing type, but is slightly
   different (eg, teleporters that don't work on players), or
2) It is necessary to differentiate between objects of the same type.  Eg,
   addition of a new skill adds a new subtype, not a new type.

If your not sure, drop a mail to the crossfire developers list.

If there is a header file that contains all the other information related to
the object type, the subtype should be defined there.  Otherwise, subtypes
should be defined in define.h.  The subtype definitions should include be
prefixed by what they are a subtype for.  Eg, SKILL_SMITHERY, SKILL_JEWELER,
etc, and not just SMITHERY and JEWELER.  It is acceptable to abbreviate the
prefix if it is very long.


C. Client Types (client_type)
==============================

Client type information in public information communicated to the client.
Client type differs from the type in several ways:

1) It is more specific than the type information.
2) The numbers used for client type are more logically grouped (all armor
   related client_types are in the same range)
3) client type info does not have a functional component in the server - it
   only conveys information - the server does not determine what an object
   may or may not do based on this.  At current time, the server does not
   even look at the client_type for any information.
4) The client_type can be used to hide the real type of an item.  Eg,
   items of client_type poison should never be sent - client_type should
   instead by booze so difficult for the client to know what the item
   really is.  similarly, special objects used in quests which appear
   as something else (eg, a key appearing as a shovel) can use the
   client type to have the type shown as the same category that
   shovels would be in.

The client_type list below has large gaps - this is to allow future items
to be grouped with items of similar type (Eg, if a new weapon type,
say two-handed is added, it should be grouped with the weapons and not
put at the end of the table).  The entire point of the client_type information
is to group the items together.

In the list below, the number in parenthese corresponds to the number in
define.h file.  At the top of each group of items, the range is given.  It is
intentional in most cases to leave the first entry of a range blank - this
gives room to place really important items of a type at the top.  Note that
only items the player may be able to pick up or apply actually need types.

Note in most cases, the artifact type items are at the top of a group listing.
This is done for artifact items that already have a different face/name,
such that the player already knows they are special anyways.

D. Animations (anim - mina) (facings)
=====================================

This section will briefly try to explain how all the animation values
(anim_speed,last_anim, FLAG_IS_TURNING and FLAG_ANIMATE work together.)


In the archetype specification, there is a anim/mina sequence which lists
faces are used for animations.  An example for the big dragon follows:

anim
dragon.171
dragon.172
dragon.173
dragon.172
dragon.131
dragon.132
dragon.133
dragon.132
mina

 Anything that is animated must have such a sequence.

FLAG_ANIMATE (anim, mina)is used to inform crossfire that this object should
be constantly animated.  A case where an anim section as above is used but
FLAG_ANIMATE is not set is for arrows and other objects in which the anim
field is instead used to determine what face to draw for different facings of
the object.

facings is used in conjunction with FLAG_ANIMATE.  This is a states the number
of facing the objects has (2, 4, or 8 - 1 is the default).  the number of faces
in the anim/mina sequence must be a multiple of num facings..

here is an example of using animation and facings:

anim
facings 2
fred.131
fred.132
fred.171
fred.172
mina

The facings go clockwise (1 north (up), 3 east (right), 5 south (down),
etc).

If there are fewer than 8 facings (which is typical), the same rotational
order is kept.  So with only 2 facings, the first half in the group will be
used when the creature is pointing to the right, second half to the left.


anim_speed is used to determine how often the object is animated.  If
anim_speed is 0, then the object is animated anytime it gets an action.
If anim_speed is nonzero, then every anim_speed ticks, the object is
animated (irregardless of how fast the item is)  last_anim is used internally
only to determine how many ticks have passed since the item was last
animated.  anim_speed is useful for objects that otherwise move very
slowly but which need to be animated more often.  Note:  If anim_speed
is used, the object must still have a nonzero speed for it to work.

In terms of frequency of animations, 1/anim_speed = object speed.
Thus if an object has speed of 0.2, its anim_speed is effectively 5.



E. Material types (material)
============================

Material       bit

Paper	    	1
Iron	 	2
Glass	  	4
Leather	  	8
Wood	    	16
Organic	    	32
Stone	    	64
Cloth	  	128
Adamantite 	256

The objects material affects how saving throws against an object affect it.
Thus, if paper is hit by fire, it tends to burn up, while iron does not.  You
can look in common/living.c to see the exact values.  Note that if the material
type is 0 (no material) or is Adamantite, the object can not be harmed in
any way.

An object can have multiple material types by adding these values together.


F. Item Power (item_power)
===========================

item_power measures how powerful and item is.  This information is only
relevant for items that are equipped - one time use items, monsters,
walls, floors, do not use this.

When a player tries to equip something, the code goes through all the objects
the player currently has equipped and sums up their item_power.  The
item_power of the object the player is trying to equip is also added.  If
this total exceeds the characters level, he is not allowed to equip the
item.

In simple terms, the sum of all the players equip items item_power must
be less than the characters level.

Powerful items should have a higher item_power value.  This basically
acts as a way to balance the items.  It also prevents gifts from high
level characters to newbies from being very useful - the item_power may
prevent the low level character from equipping this items.

For items automatically generated by the treasure code, the following
formula is used:

# enchantments        power
    0        0
    1        0
    2        1
    3        2
    4        3
    5        4
    6        4
    7        7
    8        9
    9       11
   10       13
   11       15
   12       18
   13       21
   14       24
   15       27
   16       30
   17       35
   18       40
   19       45
   20       50

An enchantment is:
Each plus an item has.
Each point an item increases an ability.
Each 20% protection an item gives (rounded normally, eg 0-9 counts as nothing,
10-29 counts as one, etc)
Each attacktype a weapon has.
Spell path adjustments ( denied paths -2 )

These properties have the following enchantment value
  *lifesaving 5
  *reflect spells 3
  *reflect missiles 2
  *stealth 1
  *xray vison 2
  *see in dark 1
  *invisibility 1
  *slay 2

This same formula can be used for custom objects to figure out their
item power.

While the item_power field in the object structure is signed, in general,
there should not be objects with a negative item power.  However, negative
effects an item has may reduce the item power.  Eg, a
'sword +4 (str +2)(wis -3)' would really be 3 enchantments.

FIXME - add settings explanation, ensure information is correct.

G. Body Location
==================

The body locations information determines where the item is equipped onto
the character.  If the character does not have the slot available,
they are prevented from equipping the item.

Some races may have a value of 0 for some locations, this denotes that they
can not use that particular item (just won't fit on them).

For monsters/players, the body location information is positive values -
this denotes how many locations they have for the different slots.

For items, the body location is negative, this denotes the spaces it
uses up.  Note that if multiple locations are set in an item, all of those
spaces must be available to wear it (it is an AND operation, not an OR).
Thus something that has body_neck -1 and body_head -1 means that both the
head an neck must be available.

Currently defined list of locations:
load/save name	 # for humans	What object types use it
body_range		1	Rod, horn, wand
body_arm		2	bows (2), weapon, shield
body_torso		1	armour
body_head		1	helmet
body_neck		1	amulet
body_skill		1	skills (holy symbols, talismen, lockpicks,
					writing pens)
body_finger		2	rings
body_shoulder		1	cloak
body_foot		2	boots
body_hand		2	gloves
body_wrist		2	bracers
body_waist		1	girdle

FIXME - Add information for legs.

Using body information:

Using this information is quite easy - for objects, just add the appropriate
body_.. with a negative value.  For monsters, put those in with a positive
value.  If a monster has a location to use an object, is is presumed in the
code that the monster should pick up/equip objects into that location.
Thus, setting these for monsters may not really match what they have,
eg, kobolds have arms, but it is still set to 0 so that they won't equip
things.  The above information largely replaces the CAN_USE information.

Note that the unqualified names above only refer to human locations.  New
locations for dragons or other creatures can easily be added.

Adding body locations:

The steps for adding a body location is as follows:

1) Update the table above for documentation purposes.
2) Update the NUM_BODY_LOCATIONS in include/object.h.
3) Update the body_locations structure in common/item.c.  Be sure to read
   the comments above the structure.
4) recompile
5) create some items that use these new locations.

Note that most the code itself sees all this as abstract - it doesn't know
what goes in what location, or even what each location is called.
However, a few bits do care - the skill stuff checks to see if you have
any arms free - thus, BODY_ARMS is defined so we know if the player
does or does not.  The alternative to this would be to have the
skill stuff do a strcmp, but then we are defining the name - easier
to just presume that the location won't change in the body_locations
table - there is no reason that it should.

H. Meaning of certain attributes for certain items:
====================================================

All objects have strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution,
charisma, experience, and spell points.  However, how each is used
varies for different objects.  Here is a PARTIAL rundown:

For rings, str, int, wis, dex, con and cha are modifiers to the users
abilities.

For treasures (chests, random_???), hp is the number of items that
should be generated.  A chest with hp of 5 will generate 5 treasures,
a random_scroll space with hp of 5 will generate 5 random scroll types (of
which, each scroll type may number more than one - see the treasures
file for more information.)

For shop floors and treasures, exp is the difficulty to use for
creating the treasure.  If exp is 0 (which it is by default), then the
map difficulty is used instead.

For armour, last_sp (ARMOR_SPEED) is the maximum speed that the
character can have while wearing that armor.

For armour, last_heal determines the penalty for spell point regeneration.

For exits:
slaying  = The map which the exit leads to.
hp,sp = (x,y) of the destination on the new map.


All items that can be applied, including items, exits, handles, and thus
can have a 'race_restriction' key. The value should be set to a : delimited
list of races that will be able to use/apply/open this item.
The list is in the form:
    :race1:race2:...:racen:
with leading and trailing :.
Note that that this only applies to players - monsters can always apply everything.
Also, Dungeon Masters are immune.


I. Lore
============================================================

Lore is a free form text field similar to the msg bug.  Its syntax is

lore
..
..
endlore

while msg's meaning is dependent on the object, lore is consistent - it
should contain background information on the object, or other somewhat general
details about the object.  It will be put into books, possibly used by npc's
and other places where general knowledge should be presented.

J. MOVEMENT TYPES
============================================================

The movement types (MOVE_..) is a bitmask that determines which method
of locomotion the object is using, and is also used to determine what
types of movement the space blocks.  From define.h:

#define MOVE_WALK       0x1     /* Object walks */
#define MOVE_FLY_LOW    0x2     /* Low flying object */
#define MOVE_FLY_HIGH   0x4     /* High flying object */
#define MOVE_FLYING	0x6	/* combo of fly_low and fly_high for easier checking */
#define MOVE_SWIM       0x8     /* Swimming object */
#define MOVE_BOAT	0x10	/* Boats/sailing */
#define MOVE_ALL        0x1f    /* Mask of all movement types */

MOVE_ALL may change in the future - it is mask for all movement types -
it sets move_block to MOVE_ALL, other places that check for all movement types
may also use this value.

It is possible to use string names instead of the numeric bitmask in the
move_fields below.  It is strongly encouraged that the string names be used for
improved readability.  In addition, using string names, especially 'all', will
result in easier maintainability in the future.  For example, if you specify
'move_block 31' right now, that is equivalent of all.  However, if new move
types are added, using a numeric option will not block the new movement types,
where if 'move_block all' was used, it continue to block everything.

The string names are same as the MOVE_ defines, but with the MOVE_ portion
removed, eg, 'walk', 'fly_low', 'fly_high', etc.  Multiple types can be listed,
separated by a space.  In addition, a - (minus) can precede the name, which
means to negate that type.  These are all equivalent:

move_block 6
move_block fly_low fly_high
move_block flying			(special symbolic name)
move_block all -swim -walk -boat

Note the order when using the -(negation) is important - the string is parsed
left to right.  This is not equivalant to the above:

move_block -swim -walk -boat all

Because it will clear the swim, walk and boat flags, and then set the flags to
all.

Also, using only negation is not allowed - you can not do:

move_block -walk

To indicate you want to remove only the walk blocking from the archetype -
you must include a positive indicator.

For all practical purposes, using negation only makes sense if using the
keyword 'all'.  However, if more movement types are added, with symbolic names
that include several movement types (eg, MOVE_LAND), using the negation with
those names may make sense.

Be aware that when the field is saved out, it may not be saved exactly as it
was specified in the load file.  This is because the server converts the
string to an int at load time, then converts it back to a string.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The fields in the object themselves:

move_type: Bitmask of above values which determines what form of movement
  this object uses.  For objects equipped by player/monster, move_type grants
  that movement.

  Note that move_type of MOVE_FLY (0x2) replaces FLAG_FLYING.

  In general, creatures will only have 1 movement type active at a time.

move_block: Represents what movement types are unable to pass this space.
  If the creature has multiple movement types, they may still be able
  to pass the space.  For example, a player has MOVE_WALK | MOVE_FLY.
  He tries to move onto a space that blocks MOVE_WALK - not a problem,
  a he just flies over.

move_allow: This overrides move_block - basically, this allows movement
  of the specific type on the space, regardless of move_block of other
  objects on the space.  This is most useful to set on objects that
  should temporary change the characteristics of the space.

move_on/move_off: Take bitmasks - represents for what movement types
  this object is activated on.  Replaces the walk/fly_on/off values

move_slow: Like move_block, but represents what movement types are slowed on
  this space.  Note that it is not possible to specify different penalties for
  different movement types in the same object.  However, multiple objects with
  different move_slow values (and penalties) can be put on the same space.
  This replaced FLAG_SLOW_MOVE, which is converted to only slow down walking
  movement.

move_slow_penalty (was slow_move) - how much the player is slowed down.
  This value is a float (before it was an int converted to a float
  at load time).  It is basically how much slower (percentage wise)
  the player moves through this terrain.  A value of 0 is basically
  a non operation.  A value of 0.5 means it takes 50% longer to move
  through the space.  The old values were all positive ints.  Basically,
  it effectively was how many ticks the player is slowed down by.

  Certain terrain has skills which reduce the slow penalty (woodsmen
  in forest for example).  As of this writing, the penalty is reduced
  to 1/4 of what it would be.  Eg, a move_slow_penalty of 1.0 would
  say it takes twice as long to move through the space.  If the player
  has appropriate skill, it would now only take that player 25%
  longer to move through the space.

  Note 2:  The old slow_move is loaded and converted into move_slow_penalty.
  The old SLOW_PENALTY and SET_SLOW_PENALTY macros divided/multiplied
  the result by 1000, so were basically a non operation.  Since it is now
  just stored as a float, conversion macros are not needed or used.

move_state/move_status: This is unrelated to this movement code - it is
  used for monster attack_movement information.  it is only noted here
  since it starts with the move_ prefix.

msg/endmsg:  If an object has move_block of move_slow and that affects
  the player movement, the objects message will be printed to the player -
  thus things like 'The jungle slows you down' or 'The wall is in the way'
  will be printed.  Various hints can be contained in the messages.

move_status: Not related to this code - noted here since it has the move_
   prefix.   This is used to track monsters state of the attack_movement
   variable.  It is worth noting that move_type was changed to
   attack_movement - this matches the name in the archetype, but is
   a name change in the object field.

Obsoleted fields:
This change of logic has resulted in the following fields no longer
being used:
FLAG_WALK_ON -> move_on
FLAG_NO_PASS -> move_block
FLAG_SLOW_MOVE -> move_slow
FLAG_FLYING -> move_type
FLAG_WALK_OFF -> move_off
FLAG_FLY_ON -> move_on
FLAG_FLY_OFF -> move_off
FLAG_PASS_THRU -> was unused, would be move_type
FLAG_CAN_PASS_THRU -> was unused, would be move_type


Special player notes:
Player can only pick up items if MOVE_WALK is set (this may need
to be expanded down the road).  Basic idea is that if you are flying,
can't reach the ground, if swimming, don't really have any free hands
to grab anything.

Misc fields:
Those fields are kind of used by all objects, but aren't really in the previous
parts.

  * death_animation (key/value): should point to a valid archetype name that
    will be inserted in the map when the object dies. It should probably be a
    one-time animation (''is_used_up 1'').

A. MAPS:
========
see doc/map-technical for this information.


B. HOLY_ALTARS
==============
(re-done code by Mark Wedel)
Holy altars are altars for the various religions.  Praying at a
holy_altar will make you a follower of that god, and if you already follow
that god, you may get some extra bonus.  Meaning of the fields

level: To re-consecrate an altar, the players skill level must be as
high or higher than the level field.  In this way, some altars can not
be re-consecrated, while other altars, like those in dungeons, could be.

other_arch: The god that this altar belongs to.  This replaces the
title field that used to be used.


C. DISEASES
===========
by Peter Mardahl

The following describes some things about the archetype
and implementation:

Stat            Property        Definition

attacktype      Attack effects  Attacktype of the disease. usu. AT_GODPOWER.
other_arch      Creation        object created and dropped when symptom moved.
wc+             Infectiousness  How well the plague spreads person-to-person
magic+          Range           range of infection
Stats*          Disability      What stats are reduced by the disease (str con...)
maxhp+          Persistence     How long the disease can last OUTSIDE the host.
value           TimeLeft        Counter for persistence
dam^            Damage          How much damage it does (%?).
maxgrace+       Duration        How long before the disease is naturally cured.
food            DurCount        Counter for Duration

speed           Speed           How often the disease moves.
last_sp^        Lethargy        Percentage of max speed--10 = 10% speed.

maxsp^          Mana deplete    Saps mana.
ac^             Progressiveness How the diseases increases in severity.
last_eat*^      Deplete food    saps food if negative

exp             experience      experience awarded when plague cured
hp*^            ReduceRegen     reduces regeneration of disease-bearer
sp*^            ReduceSpRegen   reduces spellpoint regeneration

name            Name            Name of the plague
msg             message         What the plague says when it strikes.
race            those affected  races the plague strikes (* means everything)
level           Plague Level    General description of the plague's deadliness

last_grace	Attenuation     reduction in wc per generation of disease.
                                This builds in a self-limiting factor.

last_heal       Immunity        If set, will not grant immunity when cured
                                naturally

Explanations:
* means this # should be negative to cause adverse effect.
+ means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldur
^ means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldam

attacktype is the attacktype used by the disease to smite "dam" damage with.

wc/127 is the chance of someone in range catching it.

magic is the range at which infection may occur.  If negative, this is
not level dependent.

Stats are stat modifications.  These should typically be negative.

maxhp is how long the disease will persist if the host dies and "drops" it,
      in "disease moves", i.e., moves of the disease.  If negative, permanent.


value is the counter for maxhp, it starts at maxhp and drops...

dam     if positive, it is straight damage.  if negative, a %-age.

maxgrace  how long in "disease moves" the disease lasts in the host, if negative,
          permanent until cured.

food    if negative, disease is permanent.  otherwise, decreases at <speed>,
        disease goes away at food=0, set to "maxgrace" on infection.

speed is the speed of the disease, how fast "disease moves" occur.

last_sp is the lethargy imposed on the player by the disease.  A lethargy
       of "1" reduces the players speed to 1% of its normal value.

maxsp how much mana is sapped per "disease move".  if negative, a %-age is
     taken.

ac  every "disease move" the severity of the symptoms are increased by
    ac/100.  (severity = 1 + (accumulated_progression)/100)

last_eat  increases food usage if negative.

last_grace  Reduction in the diseases' contagiousness everytime it infects someone
	new.  This limits how many generations a disease can propagate.



For SYMPTOMS:

Stats            modify stats
hp               modify regen
value            progression counter (multiplier = value/100)
food             modify food use (from last_eat in DISEASE)
maxsp            suck mana ( as noted for DISEASE)
last_sp          Lethargy
msg              What to say
speed            speed of movement, from DISEASE



D. CONVERTERS:
==============
other_arch = which archetype to convert into
slaying    = which archetype to convert from
sp         = how many other_arch to create
food       = how many items are needed to convert into <sp> other_arch



E. BOWS & ARROWS:
=================
Missile weapons

Missile weapons (type BOW) can be used to shoot missiles (type ARROW). The most
common weapons are bows and crossbows but other weapons are also easy to
implement (e.g. a sling).  The following variables have the same meaning for
both weapons and bullets:

race	type of missile (indentifies weapon and missile pairs)
dam	the basic damage
wc	the basic wc
magic	the magic bonus

And these two used only for arrows.

hp	the basic damage (internal use)
sp	the basic wc (internal use)
food	the breaking probability after a shot (0-100)

And these two are for bows.

sp		the shooting speed (% of normal speed, 1-100)
no_strength	player's strength or monster's level doesn't affect
		the damage done by bow.

The other variables has their normal meanings.



F. object creating objects
==========================
by peterm
What a creator is, is an object which creates another object when it is
triggered.  The daughter object can be anything.  (yet another way other
than runes to create surprise monsters, though runes are better for that,
they're smarter at placing monsters)

You've seen a creator demonstrated if you've solved the Tower of
Demonology:  when you summon a demon you also get some firetrails

Creator object:  an object which creates other objects.  It is usually
invisible.

other_arch      the object to create
connected       what will trigger it (button, magic ear)
hp              number of times to create before dissappearing
lifesave        if 1, it will create the object every time it's triggered,
		and never disappear
slaying		the name the created object will bear
level           the level the created object will have


G.Player Movers
===============
by peterm

Player movers are objects which move objects above them.  These objects
must be alive.  They are directional, so players can be made to move in
a pattern, and so can monsters.

Motion is involuntary.  Additionally, players or monsters can be paralyzed
so that they MUST move along a chain of movers.

Multi-square monsters can be moved by movers, however enough space is required.

Here is the meaning of various fields:


attacktype:  if nonzero, paralyzes anyone it moves (so they are forced to
	move along a chain).  Default values is 0

maxsp:  the number of moves that the paralysis will rob the player of,
        if unset, and attacktype is nonzero, this becomes 2.  By default,
	it is zero.

move_type: What movement types this mover moves (replaces maxhp to denote
	flying creatures)

speed:  how fast a chain of these will move a player along (default -0.2)

sp:  the direction--if unset (0) motion is random.

level: if nonzero, players will be moved as well as monsters.  0 by default.

lifesave:  whether it can be used up, meaning is opposite, it may go away
if lifesave is set.  default is not set.

hp:  if lifesave is set, the number of times (-1) it will move a player
  (i.e., it will move someone hp+1 times before it vanishes.). default
  0

subtype: a bitmask that specifies which of arch, name, and race affect the
         race and slaying flags. If unspecified (or zero), all will be searched.
	 The LSB is arch, the next bit is name, and the third bit is for race.
	 Table for the lazy:
           subtype 1: only arch
	   subtype 2: only name
           subtype 3: arch or name
	   subtype 4: only race
           subtype 5: arch or race
	   subtype 6: name or race
           subtype 7: all three

race: only affect objects with a arch/name/race matching this.

slaying: don't affect objects with a arch/name/race matching this.

Note from Mark:  Player Movers and Directors are separate objects, even
though they look and act similar.  Directors only do spells/missiles,
however, while player movers only do living creatures (depending on how it
is set)

H. Directors
============
Directors are objects that change the direcion of objects moving through the
air such as spells and missiles. As in the noted in the section on player
movers, they act similar, however in contrast they only affect spells,
missiles, or other flying projectiles.

Here are the various fields:

sp:  the direction--if unset (0) motion is random.

subtype: a bitmask that specifies which of arch, name, and race affect the
         race and slaying flags. If unspecified (or zero), all will be searched.
	 See the section above on playermovers for what subtypes mean what.

race: only affect objects with a arch/name/race matching this.

slaying: don't affect objects with a arch/name/race matching this.



I. Magical Walls  --  walls that cast spells
============================================
Magical walls are like other walls, except every now and then,
they fire spells.

Magical walls can contain any spell.  However, some spells do not operate
very successfully in them.  The only way to know is to test the spell you
want to use with a wall.

Several types of magical walls are predefined for you in the archetypes, and
can be found on a pick-map available in Gridarta.

If you want a magical wall which is not already defined, all you need to do
is choose one of the predefined walls, and modify the 'dam' variable.  The
'dam' variable contains the index of the spell.  See include/spellist.h to
find your desired spell.

Meaning of archetype fields:
field:		Meaning:

dam		spell the wall will cast

sp		integer direction the wall will cast the spell.  If 0,
		the wall will cast the spell in random direction.

ac		armour class of wall

exp		experience value of the wall

speed		speed of the wall--you can fine-tune how fast the
		wall will cast spells

alive		1 means it can be attacked, 0 means not

hp, maxhp	hit points

immune		immunity OR mask

type		for magical walls, this is 62

other_arch	obsolete now, means nothing

maxsp		has to do with turning walls.  The wall will turn
		by 'maxsp' every time it fires, changing face.
		To make a wall turn, it is sufficient to set this
		to 1.  Setting it to 8 or any multiple thereof is
		an exercise in futility.

level           The level the spell will cast spells at.  Level 1
                walls will cast spells at minimal strength.  Level 100
                walls will cast deadly spells.

connected	either rotate the wall or trigger it.  If triggering,
		set speed to 0 for best results.


J. Containers
=============
container <xxx>         :  the maximum weight the container can hold
			  (stored internally in weight_limit)

Str <xx>                :  reduces the weight of the objects in the container
                           0 == no reduction,   100 = weightless

slaying                 :  only let items of this type in the container

Key/value fields that can be used (trunk only):

face_opened             :  face name (including the final ''.111'') to use when
                           the container is opened. Will default to
                           ''other_arch->face'' if not defined.

face_closed             :  face name to use when the container is closed. Will
                           automatically be set if a custom face is defined, so
                           not required to set it manually.

K. Mood Floors
==============
("Brian Thomas" <thomas@astro.psu.edu>)
last_sp field is used to determine what will happen to the monster
when the floor is activated:

        (based on value that last_sp takes):
                0:  'furious'   Makes all monsters aggressive
                1:  'angry'     As above but pets are unaffected
                2:  'calm'      Makes all monsters unaggressive
                3:  'sleep'     Puts all monsters to sleep
                4:  'charm'     Makes monster into a pet of person
                                who triggers the square. This setting
                                is not enabled for continuous operation


L. Altars, Triggers, Detectors and other connected items:
=========================================================
Note: This is not quite complete documentation, but is correct as far
as it goes (0.92.1)

slaying:  What the sacrifice must match.  It either matches the archetype
name (internal value only), object name, or slaying field of object.
"money" is a special case - in this case, an exact name is not needed, any
types of money will match.

food:  How many objects must be sacrificed.  If slaying is money, then the
value of the money must be greater than the food value (ie, if food=200,
then 200 sp, 20 gp, or 4 pp will all work.)  Note that this is stored
in a 16 bit signed value - thus the maximum is 32767.

msg:  What to print when the altar is activated.

connected:  A link to another object to activate.

sp: Spell number to cast when activated.

level:  What level to cast the spell at.

hp:  If set, use hp to match to that object type.

Note:  For all sacrifice types, the number to activate the altar must be in
one object.  Thus, in the above money example, 100 sp and 10 gp would not
work.  Likewise, if the needed sacrifice was 2 swords, 1 normal sword and 1
+1 sword would not work, even though 2 of either one would.

Quick summary of the different altars:

TRIGGERS:
---------
TRIGGERS are slightly different than normal buttons/pedestals/whatever in
that they reset after a short amount of time.  Thus, they can be used to
open a door for a short amount of time.  Triggers use stats.wc as
a temporary storage value to note activation.

stats.exp is used do determine when the trigger resets.  A smaller value
means faster reset.

stats.ac is used to store the old value of the condition for TRIGGER_BUTTON
and TRIGGER_PEDESTAL to trigger only when condition changes from false to true.

TRIGGER_BUTTON: if weight on the button is greater than the weight value
for the trigger, push a trigger.

TRIGGER_PEDESTAL:  IF a matching object is on top of the pedestal, then trigger
a trigger.

TRIGGER_ALTAR: Takes a sacrifice, then pushes a trigger.
If "last_sp 0" is set, the altar will trigger the connected value TWO
times per sacrifice: Once by dropping the sacrifice, second by altar reset.
If "last_sp 1" is set, the altar won't trigger the connected value
by reset - Hence, only ONE time per sacrifice.

TRIGGER (handle):  Pushes a trigger.
Note:  At one time, there was a difference between triggers and buttons - they
were considered different types for activation.  However, now they are all
the same - a button can push a trigger, and vice versa.  And of course,
triggers can activate other triggers, and the same for buttons.

PEDESTALS:
----------
These are sort of combo buttons & altars.  If the pedestals race matches
the slaying of an object on top (race of player matches any player), then
push the connected objects.  By default, pedestals match players.  They
differ from buttons in that specific objects activate them (vs an amount of
weight.)  They are different from altars in that the object that
activates them does not disappear.

Inventory checkers (64)
-----------------------
Inventory checkers passively check the players inventory to see if it
contains some object.  Thus, you can make portals which you can't pass through
if you contain certain objects.

slaying:  Object name we are looking for.
race: archetype name we are trying to match for.
hp: match on object with that type value.
last_heal: Remove object if found.
last_sp: If set, than having that object is a match.  If 0, then not having
  that object is a match.
connected:  Value to to push.
move_block: If set, you can only pass through that space if you be allowed to
  (depending on last_sp determines if having/not having is the match
  criteria.)  if move_block is 0 (default), then the inventory only acts as
  a trigger/button.

General usage notes:  Putting a check_inventory space in front of a gate with
another on the other side works reasonably well as a control mechanism.  Note,
however, that other people may still be able to slip by.  To get around this,
use the move_block to all, and put it in the space you want to control (probably
makes sense to put a fake door or other object there to make it a little more
obvious what is going on.)

DETECTOR:
---------

This object samples the square its in, and if it finds an object named in the
slaying field, it will trigger other objects. Detectors are a lot like
pedestals - the only really difference is that they sample the space
periodically, where as pedestals will get triggered the instant something is
dropped.  The use for pedestals is to add some indeterminate time delay
(indeterminate since you can never be sure at what point in its timing the
player will actually drop something on the detector.)

slaying   name of the thing the detector is to look for. FORCEs with slaying
          fields matching slaying field of detector will be detected if hp is
          set.  SPECIAL_KEY with slaying field will match when on the ground
          (not in inventory). If equals ''player'', will detect playersname of
          the thing the detector is to look for
	  * note:  FORCEs with slaying fields == slaying field of detector
	   will be detected if hp is 1.
	  * if 'player', will match players
speed     time between samples
connected connected value of detector
sp        1 if detection sets buttons,
          another value if detection unsets buttons
hp	  non-zero if it is to search through an inventory of an object
	  sitting over it. Note that the search only goes in the direct
          inventory, not recursively in all inventories


MARKER:
-------
This object inserts a force into a player who stands on it.
This force does nothing except contain a string in its slaying field
which can be discovered by a detector.

slaying	  the code
speed	  how quickly it will mark something standing on it
food	  duration of the force it inserts.  If nonzero, the duration
          is finite:  about 1 food per 10 seconds
name	  slaying field of a force to remove.


See also the 'quests' file for special values on slaying field.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE ABOUT ALL CONNECTED ITEMS:

 Whenever an object that is connected gets activated, all other objects
with the same connected tag also gets pushed.  For some objects
(pedestals, inventory checkers) this is likely to be meaningless.  However,
if something like an altar is pushed in this fashion, it will no longer
be usable (only take one sacrifice, and being activated in this fashion
makes it so that it looks to have been activated.)

 One trick for connected objects that you want activated once:  Set your
initial connects to a set (or multiple sets) of iron spikes that are in
a 2x1 enclosed area.  On top of the spikes, put a boulder, and on the
other space, put a large button that is then connected to whatever object.
Thus, when the spikes are activated, they push the boulder to the other
space, that then activates whatever is desired.


M. Signs:
========
msg: what to print when applied.
food: how many times the sign can be read.
last_eat: how many times the sign has been read (only used internally.)

If food is zero, there is no limit on how many times the sign can be read.


N. POISONOUS BOOZE:
==================
stats.hp  Poison player or monster that applies this booze with stats.hp
          poison damage.

stats.hp must be greater 0 to do damage.  It used to be less than 0 for
-stats.hp direct damage, but that has changed.  stats.hp <= 0 now means no
damage at all, just loss of 25% food.

O. Duplicators:
===============
Duplicators copy or remove objects.  Duplicators are triggered objects.

connected: Connected value for the duplicator.
other_arch: Archetype that this copies - if the archetype on top of the
  duplicator doesn't match this, it isn't copied.  Note that it only
  matches the archetype - the object can then be further duplicated.  For
  example, if other_arch is sword, it will duplicate sword +4, different
  attacktypes, etc, and all of those are duplicated.  But it will not
  duplicate a dagger for example.
level: The number of copies to make (1 means no changes).  If set to 0
  the object is removed.

Example:

arch duplicator
level 2
other_arch sword
connected 5
end

Where 5 is connected to a lever.  When the lever is pulled, if a sword object
is on top, its number is doubled.  If there is anything else on top, it is
unaffected.  If the lever it is connected to is not pulled, it is also
unaffected.

P. Transports:
==============

Transports are objects that help the player move.  These should not be confused
with EXITS, which instaneously transport a player from one map to another.

Instead, transports may let the player move faster, give them move types they
don't have, etc.  A simple example of this would a horse.  It doesn't let the
player move anyplace he normally couldn't go, but lets him get there faster.
Ships would be another case - the player normally can't move across water,
but with a ship, he can.

Meaning of various object attributes (KV means the value is stored in the
key/value list, and thus the get_ob_key_value() and set_ob_key_value()
routines need to be used.

move_type   	The move type this object has.
move_allow	Normal meanings - useful for things like boats so people
		can actually get on the boat.
speed 		How fast the object moves
weight_limit 	How much this object can carry.
weight_speed_ratio (KV)
		This value is taken as a percentage which is multiplied
		against against the weight this object is carrying (the
		player) - this is then divided by weight_limit to determine
		the effective loading to determine effective object speed, eg:

		speed = base_speed - (base_speed * pl->weight *
			weight_speed_ratio) / (weight_limit * 100)

		Thus, if weight_factor is 0, this object will move the same
		speed no matter how loaded it is.  If it is 100, then
		if the transport is fully loaded, it moves at a crawl.
		In a sense, this somewhat mimics the player movement
		speed.  Large transports, like boats, should likely be
		largely unaffected by weight (maybe have this value at
		10), where something like a horse would have a relatively high
		value.

base_speed(KV)	This is only needed if weight_speed_ratio is set - it is used
		to know what the base speed to use in the calculation (since
		speed is getting clobbered).  If this is not set and
		weight_speed_ratio is set, the archetypes speed will be used.

passenger_limit(KV)
		How many players this transport can hold.  Thus, boats can
		transport a party (this being set to 6) while horses could
		only transport a single person.  If this is not set, a default
		of 1 will be used.

face_full
		It may be desirable to have different faces to denote what
		the transport looks like if someone is on it vs not (mounted
		horse vs just a horse).  This is used to denote what it will
		look like when loaded.  If the transport becomes empty, it will
		fall back to the archetype face.

anim_full	Like face_full above, but for animated objects.
turnable_transport
		When set, the transport will change the space it occupies depending
		on its facing direction. The transport MUST be a square (if not, game
		will simple refuse to work - don't try to mess with this).
		The pics for directions 5 and 7 must be on the top/left corner (leave blank space
		at the right/bottom). See 'arch/transport/turningboat.arc' and associated pics.

Usage/implementation details:
To activate a transport, the player will apply it just like any other object.
When this is done, the pl->contr->transport will point to the transport.
If the player is the first to board it, then transport->contr will point to the
player.  The player is placed into the inventory of the transport.

When on the transport, the player will see other objects on the transport.
When the player issues a map command, if they are the 'captain', the
transport moves as directed.  If not, the move command is ignored.  Note
that players on the transport can issue other commands (say, cast, etc).

Some special handling is done relating the player and transport speed so that
transport speed is used.  IF the transport doesn't have speed to move,
the move command is ignored.  The player speed_left is set to -0.01 when
on the transport - in this way, the player will get actions and not limit
transport speed.

When aboard a transport, the player will be in the inventory of the transport.
The player can see other objects in the transport.  If the player drops an
item, it is placed into the transport inventory, and not the map.

When hit_map() hits the transport, we examine look for all players in the
transport and damage them as appropriate.  Note that items are not
damaged.

As of this writing, transports are non living creatures, and thus can't
be damaged.

Q. Dragon Focus
===============

The dragon focus is a special item that is used during character
creation - it is used to set a dragon characters elemental focus.
During login, the archetype is looked up based on selection from the
client.  Since auto_apply is set in the archetype of the focus, the
object is then automatically applied to the character.

The apply code finds the dragon_ability_force in the player, and copies
values from the dragon focus into the dragon ability or player:

dragon ability->exp (which becomes attacktype)
player->animation
player->face
player->title

Note: This logic could be changed with a little amount of work to
work more generically for other races, allowing some degree of customization
for the face.

R. Races & Classes
===================

Objects of type RACE and CLASS and objects used for initial character  creation.

The characters base archetype becomes that of the race - thus, any fields
set in the race archetype will be set in the player object - this is
all fields - ac, hp, body information, see in dark, etc.

The actual attributes (str, dex, etc) are modifiers to the base
attributes - whether these are rolled or a point system is used.
Thus, Str +2 means the character gets +2 to strength.

For the class, the stat modifiers are also applied.  Normally, the
character will have the face/animation of the class - if a character
choose wizard, they have a wizard looking image.

However, if the race contains the NOCLASSFACECHANGE object, the
character will use the racial face.  This is used for the nonhuman
races where that is a more noticable feature than the class faces.
The NOCLASSFACECHANGE can be made present by putting it in the racial
treasure list.

For all characters, their starting skills and items is that generated
from both the racial and class treasure lists.  This can result in
duplicate treasure in rare cases, but in general, racial treasure
lists contain skills and abilities, and the class treasure list will
contain items.

With new character creation method, additional choices can be
presented to the character - the code will check for racial/class
choices, and send them to the client where the player can make a
choice.

The key/value fields are:

race_choice_%d archetype1 archetype2 ...
race_choice_description_%d description of this choice

And example for dragons:
race_choice_1 dragon_ability_force_fire dragon_ability_force_cold
dragon_ability_force_electricity dragon_ability_force_poison
race_choice_description_1 Choose a dragon focus

This data in a slightly different form will be sent to the client when
the requestinfo class/race is made.  The format for races and classes
is the same, except that for classes, it will be class_choice_%d

Any type of items could be present here - skills, armor, weapons,
spells, special abilities, etc.

If auto_apply is set in the archetype, it will be applied (using usual
apply routines) when the character is created.  This can be useful for
certain items where inserting a force object does not have the desired
effect - a specific example here is the dragon focuses - depending on
the focus, it modifies the character object directly.

Note that both race_choice_%d and race_choice_description_%d must be
present - if only one is present, the choices will not be sent.

The numeric numbers must start at one and increase by one.  For
example, if there is race_choice_1 and race_choice_3 (but no _2), _3
will not be sent, and processing will stop once _2 is not found.

The reason for multiple lines is because there may be multiple
disjoint choices.  For example:

class_choice_description_1 Choose your bonus skill
class_choice_description_2 Choose your starting armor
class_choice_description_3 Choose your starting weapon

(the archetype choice is ommitted from above list to make it
clearer).  From that list, there are 3 different choices for the
player to make - while they may be related, one can not condense those
into a single entry.

For each choice entry, the player is only able to choose one of the
values - if you want the player to be able to choose multiple values,
this could be done with repeating choices with same values, eg:

class_choice_1 arch1 arch2 arch3 arch4
class_choice_2 arch1 arch2 arch3 arch4

Where  the archetypes in both lists are exactly the same - the client
will present both lists, so the player is then able to choose 2 of the
4 items.  Unfortunately, there is no clear way for the client to
present the player from choosing the same item twice.  In some cases,
this could be OK (for example, starting with 2 healing potions vs 1
healing potion and one bow), but in other cases would not be good if
they start with 2 of the same skill or 2 of the same spell.

Note it is possible here to also provide starting packages - the
archetype in question could have a treasure list which gives the
character several different items.  A reasonable example of this might
be spellcaster packages - the player chooses wizard class, then
chooses from amongst the pyromance, evoker, etc, sub classes.  If they
select pyromancer, they get appropriate skill as well as appropriate
spells for that subclass.


*******************************************************************************
5. Flags & specifications: (usage: flag value)
******************************************************************************
Note: the flags are case sensitive.
G = generator. O = object.

Note (961129):  These notes look correct as far as they go.  However,
oftentimes, the real effect in game terms might be more complicated than
list here.  As an example:  Exp value is just base - it will be further modified
based on stats, levels, and potentially skills.

*******************************************************************************
6. TREASURES (and Abilities)
*******************************************************************************

The treasures are kept in LIBDIR/treasures.  Their format is:

treasure <name>
  <item>
  more
  <item>
  end

Also, 'treasure' above can instead be 'treasureone'.  This means
that only 1 item on that list will be generated.  The chance for
all objects on that list are summed together, and one is then generated.

And the format for an item is:

  arch <name>
  nrof <n (random 1 to n items generated)>
  magic <max-magic>
  chance <1-100%>
  yes
    <item>
  no
    <item>
  end (or "more", if this is not the last element)

If "magic" or "nrof" is omitted, it is set to 0.
If "chance" is omitted, it is set to 100%.
"yes" tells what can be generated if this item was generated.
"no" tells what can be generated if this item was not generated.
"yes" and "no" can of course be omitted.

Note: the 'no' and 'yes' fields are meaningless in treasureone
treasurelists.

Also, instead of an item, a list to transfer to can be used instead.
The format is the same as for an object, but instead 'list <list>' is
used instead of 'arch <name>'.

For list transitions, the chance, yes and no fields have the
same meaning.  'magic' is used to determine the difficulty required
to transfer to the new list.

If the list is of type 'treasureone', and a list transition fails,
what happens next is determined by the 'nrof' field.  If it is zero,
no object is generated.  If 'nrof' is one, than another attempt is
made to generate an item (or list transition) from that treasurelist.  There
is a maximum number of attempts that can be made.

Also, a reserved list name of 'NONE' is allowed.  This means that no
item should be generated (of relevance only on treasureone lists.)

To use such a treasure, just put "randomitem <name>" into any
archetype in the archetype-file.  Random treasure will then be generated
whenever such a monster is generated by generator, or when a map
containing such <monsters> is loaded for the first time.

ABILITIES

Adding in invisible objects like known spells and skills gives these abilities
to the object.

for example:

      treasure pirate
        arch skill_stealing
          chance 50
        arch skill_throwing
          no
            arch skill_punching
          end
        more
        arch heart
           chance 5
        more
        list standard
        end

or

      treasure skeletalmage
        list standard_old
        more
        arch ability_fear
        more
        arch ability_frostbolt
          chance 67
        end

Treasure lists of gods are special.  See below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOD INTERVENTION:

Treasure lists of gods are special.  They must be of 'treasure' type,
not 'treasureone', and the 'yes' and 'no' fields must not be used.
The contents of a god's treasure list is not used by
create_treasure(), but by god_intervention() which traverses this list
from beginning to end until an item causes an action.  The "chance" in
the treasure list can be used to randomly skip items, but items that
don't have an effect (e.g. healing follower, but follower isn't
injured) will be skipped anyway.  The meaning of the different items
in the list is:

Treasure list reference:

Such a list is passed to create_treasure() with flag GT_STARTEQUIP.
The generated treasure is put into the followers inventory.  The
follower can get unlimited amounts of this treasure just by praying
long enough.  See below ("other visible items") for an alternative
way of giving items to followers.

Invisible books (with specific names):

Can be accessed through determine_holy_arch() which will return the
item's other_arch field.  For example, such book with name "avatar"
determines the avatar archetype for the "summon avatar" prayer.

Invisible book with name "grace limit":

If follower doesn't have maximum grace, or follower's grace is less
than item->stats.grace, a "holy possession" prayer is invoked and the
function returns.  Can be used to limit the lower part of the treasure
list to followers with much grace.

Invisible book with name "restore grace":

If the follower's grace is negative, sets the grace to a small
positive value and returns.

Invisible book with name "restore hitpoints":

If the follower's hitpoints are not at their maximum, sets hitpoints
to maximum and returns.

Invisible book with name "restore spellpoints":

Can restore the followers spellpoints.  The maximum spellpoints for
this effect are calculated using this formula:

  max = follower->stats.maxsp * (item->stats.maxsp / 100.0)

In other words, the item's stats.maxsp is the maximum in percent
relative to the followers normal spellpoint maximum.  If the followers
current spellpoints are below 50% of 'max', they are set to a random
value between 50% and 100% of 'max', and the function returns.

Invisible book with name "heal spell":

Casts a heal spell (which spell is determined by item's slaying or
stats.sp field) and returns if the spell was successful.

Invisible book with name "remove curse":

Removes curse from all cursed (but not damned) items, returns if curse
was removed from at least one item.

Invisible book with name "remove damnation":

Removes curse and damnation from all cursed or damned items, returns
if curse or damnation was removed from at least one item.

Invisible book with name "heal depletion":

Removes all depletion effects and returns unless the follower's stats
were not depleted.

Invisible book with name "voice_behind":

The follower hears a voice from behind.  item->msg is what the voice
says.  Always returns.

Invisible book with name "message":

The follower receives item->msg as a simple message.  Always returns.

Invisible book with name "enchant weapon":

The follower's weapon is enchanted in various ways.  item->level
affects how much the weapon is enchanted, higher value means less
enchantment.

Invisible spellbooks:

If the prayer in the book is not yet known to the follower, and the
follower has the required level, teaches the prayer to the follower
and returns.  The prayer is determined by item's slaying field.

Visible spellbooks:

If the prayer in the book is not yet known to the follower, the
follower has the required level, and the follower doesn't already have
a spellbook with that prayer, gives a copy of this spellbook to the
follower and returns.  The item must have FLAG_STARTEQUIP.  The prayer
is determined by item's slaying field.

Other visible items:

If the follower doesn't already have this or a similar item (with same
type, name, title, msg and slaying fields), gives a copy of this item
to the follower.  You have to set FLAG_STARTEQUIP in the archetype
yourself if you wan't the copy to have this flag.  This method (with
FLAG_STARTEQUIP set) should be preferred for giving items to followers,
because it is rather safe to use.  The amount is limited, because if
the follower wants more of it he has to go back to an altar of his
god.  He can't pray an hour over an altar and then go fighting with a
hundred potions of restoration.

Other invisible items:

If the follower doesn't already have it this item, gives it, similar
to visible items.  Except, it ALWAYS gives it, upon conversion.
And on conversion to another religion, it is ALWAYS removed.
Signs and forces and skills may not be given/taken this way.

7. Misc change description:
***************************************************************************************
 The following area describes various comments about various pieces of
code.  In general, the information describes a basic idea of how things
work.  The following may not really be necessary, but I figure that it is
probably worth saving, and this seemed to be as good as place as any.

LIGHTING CODE (by Brian Thomas):
               - fast calculation of lighting. For players los (line- of
		sight)is calculated from a linked list of nearby lights.
		For monsters, no los is calculated, rather a modified
		check_wakeup routine is used to see if they will
		follow/attack players.  Monsters with can_see_in_dark act
		normally in dark areas.

                - New attacktype -AT_BLIND. This is a pretty severe penalty
		for monsters and players alike. Players cant see any square
		but their own, monsters can only attack/follow players who
		are in an adjacent square. Need to make the monsters stumble
		around when no player is near, rather than the current way
		in which they stand around waiting to get "ace'd". Undead
		cannot be blinded, nor should be effected by darkness. For
		other monsters, if they have immunity to blindness or can
		see invisible, they are uneffected by AT_BLIND attacks.

                - New spells. Some magician, some clerical. They work, but
		may need to be adjusted for playbalance. Normal spells
		available include: "light", "darkness", "sunspear", "faery
		fire" and "dark vision". All spells (but darkvision) work
		(do something) whether the lighting code is used or not.

                - Modified archetypes and artifacts list to encompass changes
		to the code from lighting. Also, some new archs introduced,
		namely "flint and steel" for lighting stuff on fire and
		"torch" a source of light.



***************************************************************************************
8. How to add new values
***************************************************************************************

 This section details how to add new fields/flags to an object structure.

1) Send mail to the development list to make sure that a new element is really
   added.

For flags:

2) Update the FLAG_.. entries in include/define.h for your new flag.  Recycle unused
   values if possible - there may be cases where you want to group the new flags together.
   If you are adding beyond the end of the existing values, update the NUM_FLAGS entry

3) Decide the name of your flag as loaded/saved in objects.  The default syntax is
   the name you assigned in step 2 above, minus the leading flag_ part.

4) In the common/loader.l, update the load section (where the code is mostly ^value
   SET_OR_CLEAR(...)) add  your entries in.

5) update the flag_names in common/loader.l.  The location of your names _must_ be
   in the same array location as the FLAG_ value.

6) Update other areas of the code that you presumably know about that will use these
   flag values.

7) As appropriate, update the arch files and rebuild.


*******************************************************************************
9. PROGRAMMING NOTES
********************************************************************************

This section provides some specific programming notes about objects.  If
you don't actually work with the C code, there is no need to read this section.

Almost all the char* pointers in the object structure use a shared string
library.  See Shared Strings below or on the wiki for more details.

When copying objects, the copy_object routine should always be used.  It will
add reference counts to the copied strings.

Shared string data should never be modified by any means - eg, strcpy(op->name,
"new value") will update all the objects that use the same shared string as op
does for its name.

Shared Strings
==============

Ref:  http://wiki.metalforge.net/doku.php/dev:shared_strings

To minimize memory use, Crossfire uses a shared string mechanism. This is
intended to be used for strings whose contents is not expected to change during
the server's life. Using shared strings saves memory and improved performance.

Those strings are used like regular const char*, but should not be changed via
strcpy, snprintf or other means because it would affect all structures using
the shared string. Internally, they use a counter to track at how many places
they are used. When it reaches 0, string is freed.

To alter such a string, the right behaviour is:

    * write new value in a char[] new_value variable
    * use free_string(str)
    * call str = add_string(new_value)

FIXME replace with sstring when done in code

To manipulate them, the following functions (defined in common/shstr.c) are
available:

    * const char* add_string(const char *str), used to share a string. Returned
      value is a string with the same contents that can be shared with other
      objects
    * const char* add_refcount(const char *str), equivalent of add_string when
      the string is already a shared string
    * const char* find_string(const char *str), to search if a string is shared
      or not
    * void free_string(const char *str), to decrement the use counter. After
      it's called, str should not be used anymore.

Because shared strings will return a pointer to a string if it exists, one can
see if the strings are equal by comparing the shared string address they point
to (ie str == str2 directly).
