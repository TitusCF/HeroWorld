The invoke command is used to cast a spell immediately, or when it is necessary to give a parameter to the spell. Invoke will not set the range weapon.

Examples:

    'invoke restoration
    'invoke magic rune of large fireball
    'invoke reincarnation of Iamdead
    'invoke create food of waybread

It is very helpful to bind healing spells to keys like this:

'bind invoke medium healing
c

the c key now casts medium healing instantly
