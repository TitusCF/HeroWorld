Gates...
* Comes in a huge variety
* Has a definate on and off state
* Objects on top of a closing gate will
  roll off if a free space is availble.
  Boudlers is one of the few objects
  which can NOT coexist with itself.
* Needs quite a long period to change
  state, and takes even longer if more
  than two objects needs to be rolled
  off.

Trapdoors & Teleports...
The first two `pits' are connectable.
ALL the rest activate when a player
walks on then. Except the one with
`brick work'. This trapdoor is weight
activated. EG: a player can walk on it
but a boulder can not!

msg
Magic Mouths...
These handle/trigger/button are each
connected to a seperate magic mouth to
check how `connected mouths' work.
Particularly to try and avoid having 
the mouth repeat itself.
--
Results...
 * The mouth is triggered whenever
   1/ Player steps on magic mouth
   2/ On any connected event weather
      that is a on, off or a trigger 
   3/ A player `applys' a button!
   4/ A player walks on any button
      weather or not the button itself
      activates! This includes plate
      buttons!
 * Result 2 means a button in a cascade
   will always trigger a mouth at least 
   twice! Once when `token' rolls on
   and again when it rolls off. It will
   remain so unless we can get a 
   ``trigger button'' (or alturnative).
 * A mouth can be heard ANYWHERE on the
   map when triggered (via connection?)
   Great! No radius limits?

name Handles and Buttons
msg
Handles and Buttons...
* Devices have a definate on/off state
* When state is changed ALL connected
  gates buttons and handles also change
  state. (Though it may take some time)
* Note this means a button can be `on'
  without any objects on top.
Button Specific...
* The trigger weight of buttons is
  setable. EG: You could use it to sort
  objects in a `cascade' for example.
* The trigger weight is also the button
  actual weight! As such any EXTRA
  buttons stacked underneath must
  include the weight of all the buttons
  above it before adding the desired
  trigger weight. EG: button trigger
  weight from top down: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc
* A button can be used to reset a handle
  which started a `cascade', when a
  object rolls on and then latter off
  the button.
Pedistals..
* Activates on specific object placed
  on it. Default is the player himself.
  In this case the `test_key'
* Only seems to activate trigger gates!

name Boulder Bounce
msg
Boulder Bounce...
This shows that if you have a button
under a boulder in say a cascade, and
the boulder can't `roll' then it will
bounce on and off the button. 
--
We can see this in this case as a magic
mouth will ``mouth off'' everytime
boulder leaves and falls back onto the
button. This happens too quickly to
properly effect any other device, but
shows that it is present!
--
What it does mean is that if a trigger
gate is connected to that button with a
bouncing boulder, the `reset timer' will
constantally reset, and the gate will
never close.
--
Also, if we ever do get a `button
trigger' you can not use it in a
`up cascade' (see cascades) due to
this `boulder bounce'. In a Raffles
like down cascade however their should
be no problem.

name Triggers
msg
Triggers...
* Activate once and reset
* Inverts the state of ALL connected
    gates/handles/buttons/etc...
* Can leave things in a odd state
* Only really useful for trigger gates
  or `once only' gates (from an altar?)
* Trigger buttons do not exist, though
  they could be useful. EG: turn on
  then later in a cascade turn off.
* A pedistal trigger also exists.
--
Trigger pedistals here are set to work
with the `test_key'. But I can get it to
do anything.
