_Kobold Archipelago_ (/aldwulf/*)

These maps have been written by Jan Tobias Muehlberg. Mail bug reports,
questions and remarks to <muehlber@fh-brandenburg.de>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of these maps have been written in June 2001. By chance I found back to
Crossfire in March 2006 and people convinced me to make these maps public.
Since the CF world was a mere collection of separated pitches in it's early
times and I didn'd spend many hours in finding a nice place on the current
world yet, it still looks somewhat distinct from the other maps.

However, I'm not sure whether this map set is well balanced and fair for
everybody. In general it is supposed for higher level players, but even
beginners should be save if they mind the warnings.

Have a plesant stay in one of the most populated cities of the CF world :-)
