Mail and Messageboard Python scripts for Crossfire
Joris Bontje <jbontje@suespammers.org>

Updated Oct. 2005 by Gros

This collection offers scripts and a map that allow you
to send mail (including items) to your fellow players and place public
messageboards in the game.  There is also a banking system.
It also allows for NPCs who can report on player login activity (seen.py).
(note the bank script has been moved to banksay.py)

Requirements:
- Crossfire (October 19th, 2005 CVS code or later, requires v2.0 plugin interface)
- Python (2.0 or higher)
- Python Crossfire plugin (latest)

Installation:
Should work by default if python plugin is running

It is possible to place multiple messageboards in your
game, copy the example in the map from /ImperialPost/IPO and
change 'event_say_options GENERALBOARD' and give it an
unique name.

Hooking up other NPCs to the seen script is pretty simple.

There are currently two post offices and two banking outlets, one each
in Navar and Scorn.  If you add more please follow these guidelines:

*******Imperial Post**************
The mailboxes could be put in different places, there should be a few around out there.


*******Imperial Banking**************
These are Imperial bank (actually Scuds Bank) if you want to
add some banks to non-imperial cities (?) maybe consider making different
scripts to and use a different currency and a new account database
so players can have other bank account (bankdatabase="<your bank>Bank_DB")
changing the bank notes is harder since it involves making a new arch, but
you should be able to do so with little problems.

But remember less is more....

Right now the only place to get imperial script is the bank.  I think it is better
to keep it this way and not use imperial script as treasure or make converters.
Maybe on a rare occasion have imperials as a quest reward, but remember all Python
stuff should be optional.  Do however consider using imperials for python gadgetry
(like slot machines or other such optional gizmos), but only in the Imperial lands.

Make sure you have updated the python_remove.py script to remove accounts when players quit
if you have a custom one.
