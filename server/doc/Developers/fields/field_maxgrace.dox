                "disease moves" (Assuming the host survives and doesn't use a
                curing spell). After this period the disease is naturally cured,
                which provides the host with immunity from this particular
                disease of lower or equal level.

                A negative value means the disease can never be cured naturally.

                Note that this value can be further modulated by
                spell-parameters, if the disease is registered as spell in the
                code. Due to that, most default diseases take a lot longer to
                cure than it seems.</td>
