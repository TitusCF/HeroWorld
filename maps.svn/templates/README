Templates README

This directory is for map templates - these maps should not be accessed directly but instead used to create instances of maps.  Some special considerations - each folder is a template consisting of a set of maps linked relatively.  Some special fields used:

"slaying OWNER_MARKER" 

- replace this with a string to represent the map owner(s) inventory object which gives them access to things like doors and switches.

"slaying mainexit
 hp x
 sp x
"
-replace with the actual return exit info back to where the template has been placed
