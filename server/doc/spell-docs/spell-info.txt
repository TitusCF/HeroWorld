Level
=====

	The level of a spell indicates the difficulty of the spell as
well as defining how advanced a spell-user must be before he may fully
grasp the knowledge to cast the spell.


Type
====

	A spell is either a wizard based or priest based spell.
Anyone except a cleric or priest attempting to cast a priest based
spell (a prayer) will not receive a Wisdom bonus to successfully cast
the spell (and has a high chance of fumbling the spell unless the
caster has an unusally inherent high Wisdom).


Speed
=====

	The speed (in game rounds) determines how long it takes to
cast such a spell.  The lower the speed, the faster the spell may be
cast.


Range
=====

	The range of a spell limits how far reaching the spell will
effectively work.  The range of a spell is usually denoted in 10' (one
sqaure) increments.  Thus a spell with a range of 1 will only affect
those play squares surrounding the caster.  Furthermore, there are
several other common ranges:

	When a spell has a range of "self", only the caster may be
affected by the spell.

	The most common spell range is that of "touch".  This denotes
that the caster much touch the recipient of the spell in order to
release the spell effects (as for "self", the caster may cast the
spell on himself).

	A "special" range for missile spells indicates that the spell
will last until it impacts an object (a PC, monster, or wall).  For
cone spells, it usually denotes that the range depends on some
modifer, such as the caster's Wisdom level.  If this is the case, it
will be stated in the long spell description.


Duration
========

	The duration of a spell (expressed in game rounds) indicates
how long the effects of the spell will last.  Several common ranges are:

	"instant" duration spells have effects which are noticeable
immediately.  Cone spells with an "instant" duration indicate that the
effects of the cone do not linger on game squares more than 1 round.

	The "standard" duration for spells is 500 rounds.

	A "permanent" duration is forever.

	"special" durations last until a specific event occurs, or the
"standard" duration for the spell expires.  Only one protection or
change player attribute spell may be in effect on a player at any one
time.  If another such spell is cast upon a player, then the modifiers
of the previous spell are replaced by those of the new spell.
