This directory contains 2 scripts:
 * python_init.py: called when the plugin is called. Will execute scripts in
    the 'init' subdirectory.
 * python_event.py: called when a global event (except plugin init) happens. Looks for
    scripts in the revelant subdirectory (Crossfire.ScriptParameters()) and executes them.
