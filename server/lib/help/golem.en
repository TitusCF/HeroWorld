Golems are creatures that the player has some control over. Note that many summoned creatures are considered golems, even if they are not called golems.

If you have a golem in control your spell type will be listed as golem, with the creature name in parentheses.

To control your golem, just press the fire key in the direction you want your golem to move. Your golem will then start moving in that direction, and keep moving in that direction until you change its direction.

Note that once you leave the map that the golem is on, the golem will disappear. Also, once you select another spell to cast, or change your range type, your golem will disappear.
