	  to the
	  south and starts near the guard tower on the road between Scorn
	  and Santo
	  Dominion.

	* scorn/taverns/hintson.msg: - Remove a redundant rule from the NPC
	  dialog.

2008-11-21 08:09  kbulgrien

	* scorn/taverns/goths, scorn/taverns/hintson.msg: - Add a new NPC
	  in Goths that uses an npc_dialog.py message file to drive a
	  CFDialog.py driven conversation (the conversation was created
	  before the
	  author knew about CFDialog or how to use it, but it was too large
	  to put
	  into @match as it caused a server crash). This dialog is
	  structured, but
	  state is not tracked due the informational nature of the
	  conversation.
	  The NPC drops some hints about things in Scorn that a new player
	  might
	  want to check out. There are no spoilers, but it may serve to
	  help a new
	  player find out about some things about scorn that the author did
	  not
	  discover for ages.

	  needed by a particular rule. For the inexperienced, this was a
	  showstopper.
	  - Dispense with the user defined exception and replace the old
	  handling with a
	  more effective debug log message combined with a generic
	  exception.

2008-11-21 07:30  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py: - Document how to successfully create rules
	  that do not need any pre or post
	  conditions (by supplying and empty list).
	  - Add exception handling to matchConditions() and setConditions()
	  and output
	  a debug log message to facilitate debugging broken dialogs when
	  the rules
	  contain malformed condition lists.

2008-11-21 07:02  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py: - Add a comment noting that when debugging, a

2008-11-15 07:55  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py, python/maps/witherspoon_manor/ghost.py,
	  python/misc/npc_dialog.py, scorn/kar/gork.msg,
	  scorn/kar/mork.msg, start/sigmund.msg: Modify CFDialog.py to use
	  a list of strings for the keywords instead of the "|"
	  delimited string for consistency and to reduce the need to
	  specially parse the
	  string. There seems no particular reason to stay with the "|"
	  delimiter (and
	  @match use of it does not seem compelling enough to override the
	  benefit of
	  removing the oddball parameter from both CFDialog.py and
	  npc_dialog.py scripts.
	  This commit also updates every known dialog that is affected.
	  Also updated
	  are the comments in both dialog scripts to reflect the change. In
	  CFDialog.py
	  also pluralize some identifers to better reflect that they are
	  used for lists.

2008-11-15 07:34  kbulgrien

	* scorn/mansion/witherspoon_manor_attic: Difficulty 1 for spiders

	  to difficulty 5, so changing this one to 5.

2008-11-15 05:04  kbulgrien

	* python/misc/npc_dialog.py: Add a comment that references
	  ../scorn/kar/gork.msg as an example of how an
	  npc_dialog.py conversation can be made player friendly by using
	  multiple
	  precondition flag values. Without using this capability,
	  conversation paths
	  can tend to be too linear or rigid and therefore produce
	  unnecessary player
	  frustratation.

2008-11-15 04:52  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py: Comment the code, convert a few odd tabs to
	  spaces, and make a couple minor
	  formatting changes to improve the consistency of the class
	  structure. No
	  functional changes made.

2008-11-15 04:07  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py, scorn/kar/gork.msg: The prior modification to
	  CFDialog used "|" as a delimiter for multiple
	  precondition values and overlooked the fact that the precondition
	  syntax was
	  already defined to be a list that could contain multiple values
	  without
	  resorting to packing them into a single string. This modification
	  dispenses
	  with the prior un-pythonic enhancement to CFDialog, and
	  establishes a format
	  that is more consistent with the rest of the rule structure. As a
	  result of
	  this change, Gork's conversation is also updated to work with the
	  new version.
	  A dependent script ./misc/npc_dialog.py remains unaffected by
	  this change.

2008-11-14 06:34  kbulgrien

	* scorn/kar/gork.msg: Fix, and improve, the Gork dialog in the
	  scorn/kar Gorks Quest. Add some new
	  content, and make the conversation a lot more flexible so it is
	  not necessary
	  to reset from the beginning so much.

2008-11-14 06:31  kbulgrien

	* scorn/kar/mork.msg: Fix spelling and remove spurious blank lines
	  from within the JSON.

2008-11-14 06:28  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py: Add an OR function to the CFDialog
	  prefunction as it presently only supports
	  AND. To follow precedent of using "|" in the match string (in
	  both CFDialog
	  and @match), use it as a delimiter inside the prefunction value.
	  The value
	  add is particularly that one can design conversations to loop
	  back into
	  prior states without requiring the conversation to reset and
	  start back
	  at the beginning.

2008-11-14 04:44  kbulgrien

	* python/misc/npc_dialog.py: Avoid DeprecationWarning: raising a
	  string exception is deprecated by making
	  a user-defined exception handler.

2008-11-14 02:45  kbulgrien

	* python/misc/npc_dialog.py: - Documentation improvements and an
	  additional example. No functional changes.

2008-11-14 01:28  kbulgrien

	* python/CFDialog.py: Like the @match system, CFDialog now converts
	  both match strings and things
	  the player says to lowercase before checking for a match.

	  make the change work so a lot of exits updated too, none of them
	  seems broken, but if they are that is a mistake. In the future

2007-11-04 07:50  rjtanner

	* world/world_107_128: Remove links to non-existant maps (or maps
	  that are still in /unlinked)

2007-11-04 07:20  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/jones: Make the trap on the treasure chest less
	  deadly for new players - removed the spikes trap and set a fixed
	  damage amount on the rune of shocking

2007-11-04 07:08  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/maze1: Merge existing changes from trunk; make Fun
	  House map a little more friendly to new players by replacing the
	  skeletons with zombies, then reducing the number of initial
	  zombies by 2 and also only having one zombie generator

2007-11-04 06:50  rjtanner

	* scorn/temples/valriel2: Added no_magic tiles to the swall section
	  so players can not use dimension door to enter this section -
	  it's intent is to give a balcony-like appearance to the level
	  instead of it being an actual part of the map

2007-11-04 06:28  rjtanner

	* pup_land/rainbow/Lv1/cage: Tentative fix for bug # [ 1735463 ]
	  Rainbow island quest traps player - set up a boulder and button
	  combo to reset the trap door on a timer or when a player is moved
	  to a transition area before going to the next map; found that the
	  goblins were somehow appearing in areas of the map they shouldn't
	  once the map was full of them so I removed the generators and
	  just added a fixed number of goblins

2007-11-03 22:57  rjtanner

	* darcap/darcap/circus/wurfbude: Tentative fix for bug # [1805174]
	  /darcap/darcap/circus/wurfbude Exit teleporter broken - fixed
	  coordinates on a number of teleporters and removed movement
	  detectors on the exit teleporter, added entrance coordinates to
	  make bug testing easier

2007-11-03 20:28  rjtanner

	* dragonisland/advguild2: Change so that the monster standing next
	  to the altars do not move (often, standing over the altars) -
	  change facing for Nathirel so he's 'looking at you' instead of
	  looking at the wall

2007-11-03 20:18  rjtanner

	* port_joseph/town/underground_tavern: Update map difficulty, and
	  arrange stacking order so that the platters appear on top of the
	  tables vs under then

2007-11-03 02:47  rjtanner

	* pup_land/ancient/castle/gothwolte.2: Added missing face/graphic
	  for confusion

2007-11-03 02:26  rjtanner

	* navar_city/misc/midane: Add missing map difficulty, remove the
	  wallclock archetype from branch/1.x since it's not available in
	  the branch archetype set

2007-11-03 02:02  rjtanner

	* lake_country/Butakis/houses/Jacobs_house,
	  lake_country/Butakis/houses/James_house,
	  lake_country/Butakis/luck3: Replace old and broken monster
	  abilities with current abilities or spells, typo and text spacing
	  corrections

2007-11-03 01:36  rjtanner

	* euthville/demon_quest: Replace old and broken monster abilities
	  (ability_fire) with current fire based abilities (burning hands,
	  medium fireball, create fire wall)

2007-11-03 01:27  rjtanner

	* lake_country/Butakis/luck1: Update old and broken monster
	  abilities to match current spell abilities and improve their
	  resistances so their own spells do not kill them

2007-11-03 00:16  rjtanner

	* darcap/lynn/castle1.0: Remove unholy_ground from beneath altars
	  now that their (re)consecrate level was set to level 120

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updates

2007-03-20 20:59  eracc

	* brest/amphis: Remove extra space in some monster names. Fix all
	  walls to look consistent.

2007-03-20 05:01  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq, templates/guild/guild_jeweler,
	  templates/guild/guild_thaum, templates/guild/guild_toolshed,
	  templates/guild/secondfloor: Made the Jeweler and Thaumaturgy
	  areas a stand alone map. This should improve the chances of the
	  map actually resetting to remove any broken or cursed workbenches
	  or desks if they should appear during normal player use. Also
	  made the decoration items sitting on tables for each map
	  no_pickup.

2007-03-19 23:39  eracc

	* pup_land/lone_town/bank: Update the Lone Town bank with a
	  slightly more bank-like look and new jade and
	  amberium conversion tables.

2007-03-19 17:15  eracc

	* brest/shops/a_small_shop: It appears the mana charging crystal
	  would *always* cause one's head to explode
	  in a fireball. This is not intended. Reduced the number of
	  transferrence walls
	  to try to control this effect.

2007-03-18 21:58  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two: Trying to fix my "earth to
	  dust" bullet wall that triggers when the alarm goes.

2007-03-18 19:17  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Reduced the level of banish to
	  not instantly kill devourers.

2007-03-18 18:51  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_final: Devourer players have it too easy
	  with no monsters attacking them with banish.
	  This update should make the devourer life more ... interesting on
	  these maps.

2007-03-18 00:08  ryo_saeba

	* test/python, test/python.py, test/python_exit.py: More Python
	  tests.

2007-03-17 07:33  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_toolshed, templates/guild/mainfloor: Made
	  the Guild Tool Shed a stand alone map. This should improve the
	  chances of the map actually resetting to remove any broken or
	  cursed forges or workbenches if they should appear during normal
	  player use. Also had to update the Guild Main Floor map to link
	  to the new Tool Shed map.

2007-03-17 07:22  rjtanner

	* euthville/magic.shop: Cosmetic update in how the fence (swall)
	  merges with nearby walls - essentially the small gap is removed

2007-03-17 07:18  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq: Updating the map header to take credit
	  (or blame) for this map

	* templates/guild/guild_bbq, templates/guild/mainfloor: Cosmetic
	  updates to the guild template main floor (swall surrounding the
	  bbq area). Change in functionality with the guild bbq - now a
	  stand alone map. This should improve the chances of the bbq map
	  actually resetting to remove any broken or cursed stoves if they
	  should appear during normal player use.

2007-02-21 03:31  rjtanner

	* brest/sport.jess: Cosmetic changes to the Sport Center - added
	  missing floor tiles under the trapdoors where monsters are
	  generated. Re-linked the levers to the trap doors. This map will
	  have to be watched closely for balance issues *and* for possible
	  map camping or similar abuse - it's design is very similar to the
	  old Training Centers. Some cleanup remains as many of the
	  trapdoors are using old(?) connection references.

2007-02-21 02:10  rjtanner

	* world/world_107_123: Fixed the broken path error for the Sport
	  Center, it's now accessible again.

2007-02-20 01:35  rjtanner

	* world/world_109_126: Updated the entrance coordinates from Lake
	  Country world map to Mopoon's Weapon shop, as my earlier fix
	  'dropped' the player at the wrong location in the shop.

2007-02-20 01:02  rjtanner

	* scorn/houses/jones: Reduced the damage of the shocking rune from
	  40 down to 15 as this trap was very deadly for low level players.
	  Renamed the map to accurately reflect the world map name. Other
	  changes are due to Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-20 00:54  rjtanner

	* scorn/shops/BasicSpells: Inventory sign does not list items in
	  bookshelves. Removing the sign from the shop.

2007-02-20 00:53  rjtanner

	* scorn/misc/beginners2: Corrected error with the zombie generator
	  - it was still generating skeletons. I missed updating the 'breed

	  Massive checkin. Went through many, many maps and updated their
	  names (which were either unnamed, used the actual file name or
	  tweaked their spelling and capitilization). Corrected wall
	  sections there were 'incorrect' and obvious when next to doorways
	  or similar openings - basically using the wrong wall sections.
	  Minor cosmetic updates to maps as well. Other changes are due to
	  Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:21  rjtanner

	* scorn/misc/beginners2: Replaced the skeleton generator with a
	  zombie generator as it apears skeletons are too difficult for
	  players under level 5 or 6. Added some windows to the inner wall
	  sections for easier visability of monsters for new players. The
	  centipede is another source that is the cause of frequent deaths
	  - but is still available for now. Other changes are due to Map
	  Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:18  rjtanner

	* scorn/shops/BasicSpells: Significant cosmetic changes to this map
	  in order to make it match more closely the appearance on the
	  outside. Also added an inventory inside the shop entrance.
	  Renamed the map from BasicSpells to Moseleys Magic Books.

2007-02-19 05:15  rjtanner

	* lake_country/shops/Mopoon_wshop: Significant cosmetic changes to
	  this map - added cave walls and similar sections to the map to
	  give it an 'underground appearance' instead of portions of the
	  map appearing to be blocked by nothing but darkness. Other
	  changes are Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:12  rjtanner

	* world/world_120_116: Skud Tower was surrounded my mountain tiles
	  that were impossible to pass by any means available to players,
	  made a small change (made a mountain tile 'passable') so people
	  can once again access this map. Other changes are Map Editor
	  reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:11  rjtanner

	* darcap/castle/castle2.0, darcap/castle/castle2.1,
	  darcap/castle/castle2.2, darcap/castle/castle2.3: Added missing
	  floor tiles to the Castle Zaah maps. Cosmetic touchups for
	  sections of walls next to doors - wrong wall sections are used.
	  Other changes are Map Editor reformatting.

2007-02-19 05:08  rjtanner

	* brest/sport.jess, world/world_107_123: Made the Sport Center
	  available again in Brest. Also updated maps files in Brest to
	  better match the actual map name (vs unnamed or the file name.)
	  Other changes are Map Editor reformatting.

	  Move a wall.
	  
	  Make Irritable Zorn a bit more difficult
	  brest/brest.scrolls.right
	  Someone bragged that he was easy for a level 1 character.
	  Maybe not now. :-)
	  
	  Fix a problem with an invalid archetype on
	  quests/peterm/quests/wyvern_quest

	* lake_country/dragon_hangar/hangar: Corrected a file path error
	  with the Lake Country Dragon Hangar. It was causing players to
	  get drapped in a void-like map. Other changes are due to Map
	  Editor reformatting. RJT, Feb-11-2007

2007-02-13 02:24  rjtanner

	* darcap/darcap/quest: Reverted back to using the redundant floor
	  tiles in this map - they are used for extra visual effects with
	  smoothing. My mistake. Earlier changes to the exit coordinates
	  still in place. RJT, Feb-12-2007

2007-02-13 02:13  rjtanner

	* templates/guild/guild_HQ, templates/guild/secondfloor: Second

	  Oracle.

2007-02-12 04:08  kbulgrien

	* scorn/houses/house.haunted: - Spelling: Cobwep --> Cobweb
	  - Fixed stair path: /kar/creepy.hous --> /scorn/kar/creepy.house
	  - Minor message reformat. Extra spaces and line breaks removed.

2007-02-12 03:52  kbulgrien

	* scorn/kar/gorks1: - Capitalization on Gork's name, remove line
	  break from sign message.

2007-02-12 03:50  kbulgrien

	* scorn/houses/house3.1st: - Minor improvements to conversational
	  texts.
	  - Remove redundant match strings (only lowercase is necessary and
	  plural
	  is not needed because extra characters don't stop the match).
	  - While in the file, reformat the conversation texts to remove
	  the line
	  breaks where appropriate.

2007-02-12 03:30  kbulgrien

	* scorn/houses/riverside_manor: - Remove redundant match strings
	  (only lowercase is necessary).
	  - Add a hint shown if you ask Amy "where". It's not a giveaway,
	  but could help since Mark is in a room with scad's of people.
	  - Minor line break change in text.

2007-02-12 03:20  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/lone_town/magic: - Primary reason for edit is to add
	  map_layer item to book of illusions
	  so it renders on top of the table instead of under it.
	  - Reformatted various conversation texts to remove spurious line
	  breaks.
	  - Remove redundant match strings (mixed case match strings not
	  needed).
	  - Spelling fix: sailsman --> salesman

2007-02-11 21:54  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/rainbow/roof: - Fix bug introduced when replacing big
	  lake tiles with sea tiles. The dragon
	  was blocked. Set no_pass 0 on affected tiles.
	  - Add arch blocked (w/ no_pass 0) to prevent seeing artifacts of
	  the moving
	  dragon transport if the client view is set larger than the size
	  of the map.

2007-02-11 21:31  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/lone_town/town: - Fixed minor glitch in river where
	  junction pieces were used but there was
	  no actual junction.

2007-02-11 21:25  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/rainbow/w-tower: - Reformat T.K.'s @match strings to
	  remove line breaks.
	  - Minor fix to T.K's conversation "In deep underground" --> "Deep
	  underground"
	  - Changes caused by saving with CFJavaEditor including removal of
	  "Str 1" and
	  "immune 8388607" from T.K.

2007-02-11 19:42  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/kurte/hut1, pup_land/kurte/hut2, pup_land/port_e_house,
	  pup_land/rainbow/roof, pup_land/rainbow/shore: - Primarily
	  changed "arch biglake*" to "arch sea*" so that water tiles are
	  consistent colors on various pup_land maps when using the base
	  tile set.
	  Please note: These changes require arch collection and install on
	  the
	  server. The sea.arc file has applicable edits to enable
	  transparency.
	  - Appropriate shore floor tiles placed under sea tiles with
	  transparency.
	  - Various non-functional changes result from re-saving map in
	  cfjavaeditor.
	  - Some scolar --> scholar spelling fixes (pup_land/kurte/hut1 and
	  hut2

	* pup_land/rainbow/w-tower: - Add map_layer item to statue so that
	  it renders above the note
	  that is beneath it.

2007-02-08 03:17  kbulgrien

	* pup_land/rainbow/roof: - Replace corner big lake tiles with
	  corner sea tiles so that the
	  corner water matches the color or the non-corner sea tiles.

2007-02-07 20:18  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.two: Players could become trapped
	  behind the guard gates. Fixed by adding levers.

2007-02-07 20:07  eracc

	* darcap/town2/shop_b, dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_final,
	  dungeons/gorokh/gorokh_treasure,
	  dungeons/valriel/valriel_treasure: Make sure items dropped by
	  Advocate of Gorokh do not burn. Move "asteroid" spell from Gorokh
	  treasure to Valriel treasure. Make new amulet of Gorokh for
	  Gorokh treasure. Fix large bookstore "darcap/town2/shop_b" so
	  players will not be trapped and make cosmetic changes to the map.

2007-02-05 03:27  rjtanner

	* world/world_102_108: Updated this map (Santo Dominion) so that
	  many of the linked maps no longer generate '0 destination
	  coordinates' warnings in the server log. RJT, Feb-04-2007

2007-02-05 02:19  rjtanner

	* dragonisland/advguild: Implementing more jade and amberium
	  conversion tables to different banks, per feature request
	  #1580069 'Bank in Navar missing exchange for jade.' Added
	  conversion tables to Dragon Island (Stoneville) Adventurers Guild
	  map. RJT, Feb-04-2007

2007-02-05 01:47  rjtanner

	* navar_city/misc/city1bank: Implemented feature request #1580069
	  'Bank in Navar missing exchange for jade' by adding the same
	  currency conversion tables that the Scorn bank has (plat to jade,
	  jade to plat, jade to amber, amber to jade.) RJT, Feb-04-2007

2007-02-04 09:45  rjtanner

	* port_joseph/goblin/swtower: Fix for bug # 1475095 - player trap
	  in goblin island tower. Workaround by moving the stairs out of
	  the corner (to the right) making it less likely for a barrel to
	  now block the stairway. RJT, Feb-04-2007

2007-02-04 09:08  rjtanner

	* scorn/apartment/apartments: Partial fix for bug #1555485
	  'Duplicate floor tile in /scorn/apartment/apartments' - removed
	  extra floor tiles except the ones at 0,8 since they are somehow
	  or appear related to removing the Extended wall

2007-02-04 07:30  rjtanner

	* lake_country/elven_moon/elvenmoon.3: Fix for bug #1651549, gate
	  was connected to 100 and should be 104 - other fixes are from
	  editor reformatting. RJT, Feb-04-2007

2007-02-03 07:14  rjtanner

	* world/world_104_115: Missed including world_104_115 (shop area of
	  Scorn) in previous commit. RJT, Feb-03-2007

2007-02-03 07:12  rjtanner

	* scorn/shops/BasicSpells: Fixed '0 destination coordinates' error
	  with Mosely's Magic Books, which also required destination (shop
	  entrance) updates to world_104_115 (shop area of Scorn). Cosmetic
	  updates for the book store as well. Be sure to remove
	  world_104_115 from the unique-file directory when updating. RJT,
	  Feb-03-2007

	* HallOfSelection, start/HallsOfSelection/fireborn_player,
	  start/HallsOfSelection/pl_dragon,
	  start/HallsOfSelection/wraith_player: Removed exits from the
	  HallofSelection maps, which allowed players to skip the Class
	  Selection step, since beginner players no longer return there
	  upon death - they go to the Nexus instead. This also prevents new
	  players from skipping the Class Selection step and ending up with
	  a character with minimum skills and abilities. RJT, Feb-02-2007

	* HallOfDMs: Add altars for all cults and two 'test' altars to
	  HallOfDMs ... because DMs might need to pray too.
	  
	  Since HallOfDMs has unique tiles the unique file will need to be
	  removed for this update to apply correctly. Be sure to move any
	  stuff off the map that needs to be kept before removing the
	  unique file.

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one,

	  to the next levels above floor two. Minor tweaks.
	  
	  Happy 19th wedding anniversary to my wife Annie (December 31st

	  to heck! :-)
	  
	  Let's try this commit again after having to update the entire map
	  tree thanks to Rednaxela.
	  
	  Update to Zorn Castle floor two. New modified monsters and some
	  generators added. Also mods to the floor plan. The exits to the
	  towers and to the top floor do not yet work. This floor is
	  basically "finished" and playable.

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: The Room Attendants were set

	  This is changed with this version of the map. Did the same for
	  the Senior Room Attendants. Also rearranged the NPCs to be
	  between braziers when possible to make it harder to simply run
	  through them.

2006-11-05 02:57  eracc

2006-11-03 15:04  eracc

	* brest/zorn/castle.upper.floor.one: Make a few more changes to

	* brest/brest.scrolls, brest/brest.scrolls.right: Minor
	  modifications to allow possessors of Zorn's key to get into the

	* scorn/taverns/goths: - Tags reordered due to reordering caused by
	  save in CFJavaEditor.
	  - Furniture and characters moved throughout map so that standing
	  by
	  one NPC and talking only gets a response from the NPC closest to
	  the player. Previously several NPCs answered when they were not
	  the closest NPC to the player.
	  - Character msg/endmsg text changes: redundant match strings
	  removed;
	  line wrapping removed. Minor formatting/spelling/grammar changes.
	  - Dilek: msg/endmsg refers to empty booze bottle on table, but
	  none
	  was there. Added an empty booze bottle to Dilek's table.
	  - BRAGH O'LEARY: Add match strings job and name to make it more
	  likely
	  that someone can eke conversation out of him. By default he was
	  so
	  standoffish you might not keep trying to chat with him. His booze
	  is fixed to now render on top of, instead of under, the table.
	  - West-wall wizard in red garb: One of his hints relates to the
	  Pirate
	  Den that moved to Wolfsburg. Adjusted the "easy" magic ear
	  message
	  to mention Wolfsburg in that part of the text. Also added name
	  and
	  job match strings.
	  - Wizard with an aura of great power: Added match string message
	  for
	  job and name.
	  - Slot machines had "slaying" without a target value.
	  CFJavaEditor
	  removed the lines.
	  - Bingo room table/altar on same coordinates were split up to put
	  the
	  table back in the middle line of tables.
	  - Dwarf lumberjack: Now has a "name".
	  - Mark, 1st Tier warrior, dwarf miner, beholder, dwarf
	  lumberjack,
	  wounded fighter, pirate, pupland elves, conjurer, emissary: Added
	  name and/or job matches.
	  - Reworked pupland elf's conversation a bit.
	  - Brum talked about the Black Ice mountains, but there are no
	  other
	  references to them by that name, so now he tells you where they
	  are.

	  the

	  coins - after which time you have to pay again.

2003-10-27 03:22  temitchell

	  enchanges
	  of currency to platinum. Added a cleanup routine in the
	  python_remove script to delete account when players quit.
	  A transaction fee was implemented for deposits (default 5%)
	  requires use of new arch "imperial" (bank notes with no
	  intrinsic value)

2003-09-21 07:03  temitchell

	* - changes to the sylvan styles and minor changes to the wall
	  styles that
	  are not 'autojoining' type. For some reason these walls do not
	  retain
	  some of their properties (e.g. blocks view). The code should
	  probably
	  also be tweeked to handle single arch wall objects better (or at
	  least
	  for simple walls - escape the wall joining routine and not to
	  send out
	  all those log errors for non-existant arches).
	  Walls for random maps should not have smoothing either...

2003-09-21 01:49  temitchell

	  work this
	  - patch forthcoming)

	* - add a couple things to the styles like special doors for sylvan

	  he's
	  likely to have seen lots of people.

2003-07-25 05:27  temitchell

	* - breaking out seen into it's own script, the bank stuff into
	  it's own
	  script and removing the part if the seen command that hands out
	  players
	  IP addresses to other players.

2003-07-21 01:01  temitchell

	* These are the new Brittany worldmaps, as announced on cf-maps
	  mailing list:
	  Brittany is now enclosed by a ring of no-pass mountains.
	  There are two passages where the road leads over the mountains.
	  Players need to fight and survive the mountain tops in order
	  to enter Brittany.
	  
	  Additionally I added a direct road to Lake Country.
	  I have also replaced all wastelands inside Brittany by
	  snowy mountains.

	  to
	  accommodate. A couple new maps heavy on the training would be
	  good
	  here. This area is not entirely for low levels (the new river way
	  looks good for a sewer
	  adventure) but should cater to new players. Scorn central square
	  has
	  been made more snappy too.
	  There may be some loose ends to tie up (the signage should be
	  redone a
	  bit) and I'll get on that post haste.

	  maps,
	  that were either fixed, or created newly by Joel South. Part of
