    X is a bit-wise combination expressed in hexadecimal form.  For example,
    8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = F describes a vertical cross, and 4 + 1 = 5 identifies a
    vertical wall.

    P, D, and A are always 1.

    offered by the arch.  If d   Object Names:

        When creating .arc files, the object name is determined by a similar,
        but distinctly different, scheme.  See the server code in
        server/build_map.c and random_maps/wall.c for the source of the
        information that follows.  The arch name (ie. awall) must not have any
        underscores.  A suffix in the form _U[_V[_W]] is appended to the arch
        name.

        U is the number of connection points (ie. for a pillar U == 0, and for
        a cross U == 4).

        At the time of this writing, the formulae for calculating V and W is
        not known, but, U, V, and W can be determined as follows.  Calculate a
        value called "connect" by adding the values of the connecting points:

               4
               |
            1 -0- 2
               |
               8

        Then use "connect" to pick a suffix:

            0:  _0
            1:  _1_3
            2:  _1_4
            3:  if (has_window)
                    _win2
                else
                    _2_1_2
            4:  _1_2
            5:  _2_2_4
            6:  _2_2_1
            7:  _3_1
            8:  _1_1
            9:  _2_2_3
            10: _2_2_2
            11: _3_3
            12: if (has_window)
                    _win1
                else
                    _2_1_1
            13: _3_4
            14: _3_2
            15: _4

    For a complete example, a vertical cross wall graphic in an awall arch set
    is named awall_F.base.111.png.  Face information is kept in awall_F.face,
    and the archetype data is in awall.arc.  Inside awall.arc, the Object name
    is awall_4.

Diagonal (extended) walls, roads, etc.

    The legacy wall-naming convention is used in conjunction with the
    extension to the name format described here to provide a uniform naming
    scheme that supports corner connections.  Legacy names do not need to
    change to simply add diagonal versions of the legacy graphics.

    The name format is name_XY.arc, name_XY.PDA.png

    X follows the same rules as used for the legacy wall format, except that
    when there are no NSEW connecting points, X == 0.

    Y may be omitted, or may be 0 if diagonal connecting points are not
    offered by the arch.  If diagonal connecting points are implemented, Y is
    a bit-wise combination computed in the same manner as X, and is also
    expressed as a hexadecimal digit.  The difference is that it refers to
    corner connections:

        1   2
         \ /
          X
         / \
        8   4

    For example, name_0F refers to a diagonal cross, or connecting points in
    all four corners.  name_05 and name_0A refer to pure diagonals.

    Since diagonal pieces require corner fills, P is used to differentiate the
    component parts of the diagonal.

        P (part number) ranges from 1 to 3.

            1 : used for "normal" pieces that connect direction points.

            2 : used for a top corner fill needed to complete diagonal
                connections.

            3 : used for a bottom corner fill needed to complete diagonal
                connections.

            Examples of diagonal files are dirtroad_05.211, dirtroad_05.311,
            dirtroad_0A.211, and dirtroad_0A.311.  The archetypes for these
            are stored in dirtroad_05.arc and dirtroad_0A.arc.  The corner
            fill is a "part" of a diagonal, and is not really useful on its
            own.

            The .211 and .311 file names are based on the full diagonal, but
            are used for all diagonal connecting points.  Usually it is not
            necessary to customize the corner piece to fit each and every
            possible XY combinationi that incorporates a diagonal connecting
            point.

     Object Names:

         When creating object names, use a different format (_U_XYP) unless
         the legacy naming format can be figured out and adapted to the
         diagonal set - in which case, it should be documented here.  This
         format allows consistent object naming in the event that renaming is
         desirable in the future, and it does not collide with the legacy
         object naming.

         U  = Number of connecting points.
         XY = Where X and Y are re-used as described above.
         P  = Where P is the part number.

Cave:

    Complex

River names:

    NOTE:  Consider deprecation of this format in favor of the extended wall
    naming.  It is more flexible than this format.

    Simple diagonals, like non-branched rivers, are saved as name_XY.arc and
    name_XY.PDA.png.

        X and Y use the direction scheme shown above (and copied here for
        ease of reference).  For example, river_15 runs north/south; river_26
        runs from the northeast to the southwest.

            8  1  2
             \ | /
            7- 0 -3
             / | \
            6  5  4

        X and Y do not define direction of water flow.  They are simply
        connecting points to neighboring arches of the same set.  X and Y are
        ordered low to high, so it is not expected that a river_62 exist;
        instead the piece is named river_26.

        A cul-de-sac, or dead-end could have X == 0 and Y set to the connect
        point.  Conceptually, a pool could follow this same naming convention
        and set X == Y == 0.

        D and A are presently always set to 1.

        P ranges from 1 to 3.

            1 : used for "normal" pieces that connect direction points.

            2 : used for a top corner wedge used to fill in diagonals (i.e. A
                wedge in the top right or top left corner).

            3 : used for a bottom corner wedge used to fill in diagonals (i.e.
                A wedge in the bottom right or bottom left corner).

            Examples of wedges are river_48.211, river_48.311, river_26.211,
            and river_26.311.  The archetypes for these are stored in
            river_48.arc and river_26.arc.  The wedge is a "part" of a
            diagonal, and is not really useful on its own.

    River junctions, add another digit to the format used by simple diagonals,
    and are stored as name_XYZ.arc and name_XYZ.PDA.

        X, Y, and Z represent the three directions the river exits.  367 would
        be east,southwest, and west.  Junctions, or branchesi, may also have
        multiple parts - this happens when the junction has a diagonal
        direction.

        By convention, directions for the river parts are in ascending order.
        That is, if the exit locations are 2, 6, 3, the name could be
        branch_236 (not branch_326, or branch_623, etc).

    Complex branching paths could be set by adding digits to allow four or
    more connecting points, but use of the extended walls format is
    recommended instead.
