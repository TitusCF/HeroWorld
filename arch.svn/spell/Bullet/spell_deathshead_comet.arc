This comet spell is for the Deaths Head monster.
It is not for normal players. It is so monsters
can cast something like Metor Swarm without 
bringing down the server.
The comet spells fires a comet in a specified
direction.  This comet inflicts serious
physical harm on whatever it hits, and then
bursts into fire.
