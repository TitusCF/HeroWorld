crossfire (0.95.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  	+ Biggest change for Debianers: the /var/lib directory was split
      to be more FHS compliant and I took advantage of that.  Maps
      and artifacts and archtypes and all such files are now looked
      for in /usr/share/crossfire/*.  Players, highscores, temp maps
      and "unique item saves" are all that are stored in /var/lib/*
      now.
  * I am running a server at benham.net..  It's pretty much straight
    out of the deb and I use it to test my deb.  It might, therefore,
    not be 100% reliable but it's a place to play.
