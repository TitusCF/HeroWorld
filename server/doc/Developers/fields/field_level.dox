            certain literacy level to succeed reading the book. The book can be
            read if: mental_level greater &lt;literacy level&gt; - 5. Adding
            level to a book can be a nice idea, personally I like it when a
            player needs more than his fighting skills to solve a quest.
            However, keep the book level at least below 15 because it is quite
            hard to gain high mental levels.</td>

            only dragon players. Normally this value reflects the level of the
            monster from which the flesh item originates. Dragon players always
            search for flesh of highest level possible, because it bears the
            best chance to gain high resistances.</td>

            But in fact, it does not seem to have an effect. Set any non-zero
            value to be on the safe side.</td>

@ref page_type_56
		</td><td>            To re-consecrate an altar, the player's wisdom level must be as high
            or higher than this value. In that way, some altars can not be
            re-consecrated, while other altars, like those in dungeons, could
            be.

            Altars located in temples should have at least &lt;reconsecrate
            level&gt; 120. Some characters might need those altars, they would
            be very unhappy to see them re-consecrated to another cult.</td>

            deadly spells. Arch default is level 1 - you should always set this

                monsters get moved. Remember that "monsters" includes NPCs!

                This feature provides you with the possibility to make NPCs
                literally "come to life". Example: The player is talking with an
                NPC, speaking a certain keyword. This triggers a magic_ear and
                activates creators, creating (per default: monster-only) movers
                under the NPC's feet. The NPC starts "walking" on a predefined
                route! Note that it's useful to set this NPC immune to
                everything, preventing the player to push the NPC off his trace.</td>

            whatever. (&lt;rune level&gt; 0 runes won't detonate at all!)

            Level Also effects how easily a rune may be found and disarmed, and
            how much experience the player gets for doing so. Beware: High level
            runes can be quite a cheap source of experience! So either make them
            tough, or keep the level low.</td>
