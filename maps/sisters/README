This directory is the 'valley of the sisters' by Brian Thomas.

 
This was re-arranged a bit by me when placed on the new large
world map.  Hopefully, this will make it easier to find, without changing the
character of the maps much.

 Most of the change was to try and keep it with the same style as the other
maps on the bigworld (eg, no towns).
