# Script for the lockable door and key.

#
# Lockable doors have 2 components:
# - doors, which have the 'lockable 1' attribute
# - locking keys, which have a apply handler pointing to this script
#
# Rules are as follow:
# - the 'slaying' field is used to match doors and keys
# - locking keys start blank (empty slaying)
# - applying a blank key to an unlocked door locks the door and assigns the door to the key,
#  the key gets a '(used)' appended to its name
# - applying a valid key to a locked/unlocked door unlocks/locks
# - locked doors must be alive, unlocked mustn't be
# - the 'other_arch' field is used to link locked and unlocked variants
# - the following fields are changed when un/locking takes place: name, move_block,
#  move_allow, face. This allows customization of the doors (prevent walk but not fly, for instance)
#
# Right now, the following archetypes use this system:
# lockable_vdoor, lockable_vdoor_locked, lockable_hdoor, lockable_hdoor_locked, locking_key
#
# Feel free to use those as a base.
#
# Note: using a DOOR (type 23) instead of a LOCKED_DOOR (type 20) doesn't seem to
# work, since any key can remove the door - not the desired behaviour.
#
# If the lockable door has the correct 'trigger' hook (case for the previous archetypes),
# then the door can be picked, depending on the player's lockpicking level.
# Experience is awarded for the first successful pick only. Failures decrease the
#Â chance to succeed, and increase the chance of leaving traces.
