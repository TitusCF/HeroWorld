<H1> Chapter 1 - Introduction</H1>

<H2><A name="1.1.0">What is <em>Crossfire</em> ? </a></h2>

In the words of its original author Frank Tore Johansen :<P>
``<em>Crossfire</em> is a multi-player graphical arcade and adventure game
made for the X Windows systems environment. It has certain flavours from
other games, especially <em>gauntlet</em> and the rogue-like games (mainly
<emhack , moria , angband,</em> and <emragnarok</em> ). Any number of
players can move around in their own window, finding and using items and
battling monsters. They can choose to cooperate or compete in the same
<em>world</em>.''  <P>

In the years of development that have followed, <em>Crossfire</em> has grown to
encompass over 150 monsters, ~3000 maps to explore, an elaborate
magic system, over 15 character types, a system of skills, and
many, many artifacts and treasures. <p>

<em>Crossfire</em> is freely distributed under the GNU license and the code may be
obtained from a number of FTP sites (
<a href="#1.3.0">Obtaining crossfire</a>).
<b>Take note:</b> you will need at least an ANSI C compiler (i.e. <em>gcc</em>)
and UNIX to build the game.  <em> X Windows are necessary to play.</em>

<em>Crossfire</em> is currently being maintained by Mark Wedel
(<samp>mwedel@pyramid.com</samp>) and is awaiting the ``great leap forward''
to a true client-server status (Look for version 1.0+). Not to fear,
<em>Crossfire</em> is certainly playable in its present form!  But the game
is in flux and new releases of <em>Crossfire</em> occur on a quasi-monthly
schedule. You may want to subscribe to the announcement mailing list (see
section <A href="#1.2.0"> mailing lists</a>) to get notified of updates.<p>

<h2><A name="1.1.1">1.1.1. What is included in this document?</h2>

This document is a guide intended to focus on the game-play aspects of
<em>Crossfire</em>.
The original intention of this text was to
help aspiring players create and play a character and more quickly initiate
them into the intricacies of <em>Crossfire</em> . But, as things went along, many of the
older docs began to be incorporated and lots of good reference material
slipped in; this document may also be a good resource for more experienced
players.<p>

Having said all of that, lets point out that each release contains a fair
amount of documentation and the <em>Crossfire</em> Player's Handbook is
definitely not the last word! Certainly, every player will want to obtain
the <A href="../spoiler-html/spoiler.html">spoiler</a>, and while this may
sound flippant, its still true\emdash a good place to start tracking down
much of the information you may want is the README document in the top
directory of your release.<p>


<h2><A name="1.1.2">1.1.2 Getting started: beginning players</h2>

First-time players may want to skim over sections
<a href="chap2.html#2.1.0">character attributes</a>,
<a href="chap2.html#2.2.0">generating a character</a>,
<a href="chap3.html#3.1.0">Basics</a>, and
<a href="chap7.html#7.1.0">Beginning players</a> before playing the game. Don't be daunted by the apparent
complexity of <em>Crossfire</em> - in reality <em>Crossfire</em> is quite
easy to play and character generation is simple. Later on, when you have
some experience playing the game, you may wish to go back and re-read
skimmed material and expand your knowledge of the unread sections. <p>

If you just want to damn the torpedoes and ``roll'' up a character quickly
then proceed to section <a href="chap2.html#2.2.0">generating a character</a>,
in this text. You may <em>still</em> find section <a href="chap7.html#7.1.0">Beginning players</a> helpful
reading. <p>


<h2><A name="1.2.0"><em>Crossfire</em> Mailing Lists</h2>

Two mailing-lists exist; the first is for discussing bugs and development
while the second is for just announcing new versions.  If you want to join
or leave any of the lists, send mail to
<samp>crossfire-request@ifi.uio.no</samp> with the subject
``<samp>subscribe</samp>'', ``<samp>unsubscribe</samp>'',``<samp>subscribe
announce</samp>'' or ``<samp>unsubscribe announce</samp>''.  If you use the
subject ``<samp>subscribe</samp>'' or ``<samp>unsubscribe</samp>'' you will
(un)subscribe to <em>both</em> lists.<p>

To send messages directly to the list, mail <Samp>crossfire@ifi.uio.no</samp>.
While the development/bug list is not supposed to be used for helping
players solve problems, sometimes a knowledgeable reader of the
list can be tempted into answering your question.<p>

An archive of old messages can be found at <samp>ftp.ifi.uio.no</samp> in the
directory <samp>/pub/crossfire/archive</samp>.
