Trolls are usually nasty creatures: scions
of Gnarg. They have amazing strength and
hardiness, but they're a bit clumsy, very
stupid, impious, and bad at handling and
obtaining magic.  They heal with amazing
rapidity and can see in the dark.  Because of
the above attributes, they're great in any
fight.  Well, they're great until someone
waves torches at them: fire presents great
peril to trolls.

Most trolls are destroyed on sight by
civilized people: but a few have proved
deserving of tolerance and are permitted to
enter cities.
