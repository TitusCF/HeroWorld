name The Sannista by Unknown
msg
Shortly summarized, the Sannista is a legendary flying boat that was powered by the reaction of a fire and a water elemental. It was built by the tenth Commander of Euthville, Farkennis, as a gift for the 18th Birthday of his daughter, Sannista. That?s the boat that was stolen by Fax when he fled from Euthville, and that he used to get to Khelens. Giusitta the Verbous then sailed it back to the Continent, and hid it ?somewhere in the mountains of Euth?.

msg
And so the Temple of Justice was founded, to show Valriel's Glory to the whole world!

Oh, it was magnificient, located on the north side of the Continent, west of Darcap.

And for years followers of Valriel came as pilgrims, to worship His Altar.

But things started to fall over, and slowly the priests started to accumulate wealth instead of giving it back, and using it for their glory instead of Valriel's.

So the Temple was slowly abandonned by pilgrims, who sought other Places Of Glory.

It probably still exists, but who knows what secrets it bears.

name The Enchanted Music by Unknown
msg
Many said that, if the Enchanted Music could be found, it would open the gates of many treasures, but because none of the former Euthvillians survived, and because nobody knows where the Boy went afterwards, those gates are still closed. I?ve heard that the School of Daemonology was precisely founded to rediscover that spell. But who am I to claim this to be true? I?m only a man of the past that tells stories before a fire, and the fire is dying, and so has my tale reached the end.

name The Imperial Highway by Unknown
msg
The proverbial ?Yellow Brick Road? (nicknamed because the durable yellow clay used to make the bricks) which strings its way across the Main continent of BigWorld, the Imperial Highway was created during the time of the Empire and is a lasting legacy of a more peaceful time. Travel along the Imperial Highway is still reasonable safe as the road is maintained and there are inns and shops along this road.

Straddling the corner of the Imperial highway as it turns North near the Eastern border of the known world, and surrounded by dangerous territory, Navar is an unlikely site for one of the world?s grandest cities. Yet there it stands, dominating the skyline for miles around and showing the same bustling activity expected of any thriving market town.

msg
Know that there are 4 principle philosophical ingredients. In order, they are:

   - philosophical salt
   - philosophical sulphur
   - philosophical phosphorus
   - philosophical oil

  The great alchemist has often said that all living things are made of these ingredients. Proper combination of these with other base objects can often create potions of power and might.

name An Attempt at Alchemy by Unknown
msg
...and then did the Alchemist agree to make me my potion.

First he called to his grimm servants who hauld forth a great iron cauldron. Into this black device did he deposit his ingredients and, opening his spell book for reference, then did he cast his spell of alchemy therepon the cauldron.

Greatly did the tub shake and move!

I thought that the Alchemist had broke his device, but he chuckled at my ignorance. Into the cauldron did he reach an brought forth a filled bottle of golden amber fluid...

msg
Many said that, if the Enchanted Music could be found, it would open the gates of many treasures, but because none of the former Euthvillians survived, and because nobody knows where the Boy went afterwards, those gates are still closed. I?ve heard that the School of Daemonology was precisely founded to rediscover that spell. But who am I to claim this to be true? I?m only a man of the past that tells stories before a fire, and the fire is dying, and so has my tale reached the end.

Shortly summarized, the Sannista is a legendary flying boat that was powered by the reaction of a fire and a water elemental. It was built by the tenth Commander of Euthville, Farkennis, as a gift for the 18th Birthday of his daughter, Sannista. That?s the boat that was stolen by Fax when he fled from Euthville, and that he used to get to Khelens. Giusitta the Verbous then sailed it back to the Continent, and hid it ?somewhere in the mountains of Euth?.

And so the Temple of Justice was founded, to show Valriel's Glory to the whole world!

Oh, it was magnificient, located on the north side of the Continent, west of Darcap.

And for years followers of Valriel came as pilgrims, to worship His Altar.

But things started to fall over, and slowly the priests started to accumulate wealth instead of giving it back, and using it for their glory instead of Valriel's.

So the Temple was slowly abandonned by pilgrims, who sought other Places Of Glory.

It probably still exists, but who knows what secrets it bears.

The proverbial ?Yellow Brick Road?

Travel along the Imperial Highway is still reasonable safe as the road is maintained and there are inns and shops along this road.

The proverbial ?Yellow Brick Road? (nicknamed because the durable yellow clay used to make the bricks) which strings its way across the Main continent of BigWorld, the Imperial Highway was created during the time of the Empire and is a lasting legacy of a more peaceful time. Travel along the Imperial Highway is still reasonable safe as the road is maintained and there are inns and shops along this road.

name The Sannista by Unknown
msg
Shortly summarized, the Sannista is a legendary flying boat that was powered by the reaction of a fire and a water elemental. It was built by the tenth Commander of Euthville, Farkennis, as a gift for the 18th Birthday of his daughter, Sannista. That?s the boat that was stolen by Fax when he fled from Euthville, and that he used to get to Khelens. Giusitta the Verbous then sailed it back to the Continent, and hid it ?somewhere in the mountains of Euth?.

And so the Temple of Justice was founded, to show Valriel's Glory to the whole world!

Oh, it was magnificient, located on the north side of the Continent, west of Darcap.

And for years followers of Valriel came as pilgrims, to worship His Altar.

But things started to fall over, and slowly the priests started to accumulate wealth instead of giving it back, and using it for their glory instead of Valriel's.

So the Temple was slowly abandonned by pilgrims, who sought other Places Of Glory.

It probably still exists, but who knows what secrets it bears.

Many said that, if the Enchanted Music could be found, it would open the gates of many treasures, but because none of the former Euthvillians survived, and because nobody knows where the Boy went afterwards, those gates are still closed. I?ve heard that the School of Daemonology was precisely founded to rediscover that spell. But who am I to claim this to be true?

name The Fortress of Ang
msg
In ancient times past the great fortress of Ang was raised on the eastern shore. Many inhabitants it has had, but the last known was the most unusual.

A titan of rare power is said to live in Ang now. There he serves as guardian of an artifact of unusual might.

The exact location is now lost, but rumors locate it east, north-east of Navar, near the southern shore.

name The Imperial Highway by Unknown
msg
The proverbial ?Yellow Brick Road? (nicknamed because the durable yellow clay used to make the bricks) which strings its way across the Main continent of BigWorld, the Imperial Highway was created during the time of the Empire and is a lasting legacy of a more peaceful time. Travel along the Imperial Highway is still reasonable safe as the road is maintained and there are inns and shops along this road.
