Word of recall transports the character back
to the last place where he or she used a Bed
to Reality.
There is some delay between casting the spell
and its effect, so this spell is not a great
choice to cast if you are about to die, as
you will likely die before the spell actually
transports you back home.  It can be most
handy when in a deep dungeon and don't want
to walk back up all the stairs.
