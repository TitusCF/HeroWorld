name Identifying
msg
Dont just apply or sell any old stuff you find lying around without first identifying them. Items sell for much more money when they are identified. Also some items can be cursed or damned, so applying un-ided items can lead to wearing one of those, which can't be unequipped normally. If you are wearing a cursed or damned item, pray over your gods altar or read a scroll of remove curse/damnation. To identify stuff, use the appropriate skill ('use_skill literacy' to identify books/scrolls, etc.) or cast the identify spell, or pay to have items identified at a shop.

name Instanced Maps
msg
Some maps create a unique version (or instance) of that map for every player that enters, so that if two people enter the same building at same time, they still end up in different versions of that map. Specifically, private apartment buildings behave in this way. That allows you to store all your items without the fear of some other player taking them.

name Other Stats
msg
Dam is your melee dmg. WC is weapon class, which is like accuracy (lower values are better). AC is armour class, which is like dodging ability (lower values are better). Speed is movement speed. Weapon speed is # of attacks per unit of time. Armour is resistance to purely physical damage. There are other types too, like fire, elec, weaponmagic, poison, etc.

name Dieing
msg
When your hp reaches 0, you die which teleports you to the last bed to reality you slept in. Dieing makes you lose a little experience, but there is a floor to how much you can lose if you die repeatedly, equal to half the total exp you ever earned. Also your stats get depleted when you die (not permanently). To restore them, you need to drink a potion of life or pray over your god's altar (repeatedly).

name Background Story
msg
The human king of the mainland funded expeditions to find new land. One expedition found this island, and made a camp where this port is now. They found flecks of gold in the river east of town, and informed the king. Upon hearing this, the king demanded a full blow colony be built, in order to find and harvest the gold. The colony flourished, despite not having yet found the gold. Eventually however, it was discovered that there is an ancient fire dragon living on this island in a volcano at the center. It attacked randomly and violently, eventually forcing the town to have it sealed in the volcano while it slept, by powerful runes. These runes however, won't last forever. There needs to be a more permanent solution. This is where you come in, the Lord of this island needs your help. Seek him out at the main castle of this colony, north of here.

name Basic Combat
msg
Ctrl+arrow keys to run, running into something attacks it with melee. 'cast' lists your spells (if any), 'cast <spellname>' readies it. Once a spell is readied, shift+arrow keys fires it. Apply a missile weapon, then shift+arrow fires it if you have ammo. If your missile weapons skill gets un-readied, use 'ready_skill missile weapons'. Often you are alot more deadly with keybinds ('bind' command), such as binding 'invoke magic bullet' to a single key, so one press fires. If you screw up a bind, use 'unbind' command.

name Religion
msg
At the start, you don't worship any gods. But if you get the praying skill (or find a holy symbol), you can pray over an altar to worship that god. The altars are in the cathedral at the main castle north of here. You have to be a follower of a god to be able to cast prayers. Worshipping a god has positives and negatives, such as gaining/losing resistances, special prayers, etc. Gods can also restore your stats if you died, bless your weapons or grant items (under certain conditions), and etc.

name Getting Started
msg
First thing you should do is make sure you saved (talk to the man at the docks if you haven't yet). Then try to gain a few levels before leaving the safety of this port town. (by killing stuff in the buildings) Make sure to buy some basic supplies, food, armour, etc. Whatever you can afford with your starting money. Next you should probably go to the castle north of here, for various reasons such as becoming a follower of a god, starting the main quest, etc.

name Racial Stat Max
msg
Each race has a cap for innate values of the 7 stats (str,dex,con,int,wis,pow,cha). You don't necessarily start at this max. For example, when you roll your stats at creation, you might be a human that ends up with 17 str, 18 dex, 19 con, 20 int, 20 wis, 15 pow, 17 cha (or something like that). The human's racial max is 20 to every stat. To become 'racially-maxed', you need to find and drink stat potions. A human that has 20 to every stat while wearing nothing is racially maxed. Also like stat potions there are improvement potions, which slightly raise your hp/sp/gr until you are 'perfect'.

name Basic Survival
msg
Try to escape and regenerate health if you are almost dead. Fight with your back to a wall or in narrow corridors to minimize your vulnerability surface area. Don't forget to eat food, it supplies you with food points which are needed to regenerate hp or sp. If your food bar reaches 0, your health actually degenerates, leading to death eventually. You can find food in the wilderness or in shops or on monsters, etc. Assume treasure chests and doors are rigged with traps.
