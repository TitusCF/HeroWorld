            Possible choices for &lt;container class&gt; are: "gold and jewels",
            "arrows" and "keys".

            Unfortunately it is not easy to create new container classes,
            because items need a matching counter piece attribute to the &lt;container
            class&gt; before they can be put inside a container. This attribute
            ("race") is set only for the existing container classes.</td>

            "&lt;race&gt; *" means every creature can be infected.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_213, @ref page_type_28
		</td><td>            Every monster should have a race set to categorize it. The monster's
            &lt;race&gt; can have different effects: Slaying weapons inflict
            triple damage against enemy races and holy word kills only enemy
            races of the god.</td>

		<td>
@ref page_type_13
		</td><td>            Only shooting weapons with matching &lt;ammunition class&gt; can
            fire these projectiles. For arrows set "arrows", for crossbow bolts
            set "crossbow bolts" (big surprise).

            In certain cases, the ammunition class is displayed in the game.
            Hence, when you create a new ammunition class, choose an intuitive
            name like "missiles", "spirit bolts" - whatever.

            You can also make special containers holding these projectiles by
            setting the &lt;container class&gt; to match your &lt;ammunition
            class&gt;.</td>

                &lt;spell name&gt; "summon evil monster", the rune will summon a
                bunch of those on detonation. (dam and attack type will still be
                ignored in this case). Runes are even capable of summoning
                multi-square monsters, given enough space. You'd better test it
                though.</td>

            set "crossbow bolts".

            you create something fancy like a building which is in fact meant to
            be a huge animal. Note that shovels slay walls, so they do triple
            damage against weak walls.</td>
