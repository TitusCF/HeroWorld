NOTES
=====

This is the first release of the spell documentation.  Please send me
your comments and tell me what you think!

At the moment, the postscript version of the files are only enscripted
and look rather bland.  If you know of a relatively painless way of
maintaining ascii text and postscript versions, I'd love to hear from
you.

Announcements of revisions will be made to the crossfire mailing list.
This update is dated March 26, 1993.

If you create new spells for Crossfire, please send me a description
of the spell (so I don't have to trudge through the code to figure out
the effects).  Thanks!

Look for further development from the ODU Crossfire Development Team
soon! (falken@cs.odu.edu)

Note by Frank: This documentation was made for 0.89.2, and is somewhat
               outdated for this release.
