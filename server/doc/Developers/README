This is a README for the Developers directory for crossfire.

This directory contains files of interest to those that actually develop
crossfire (map makers, coders, etc).  Files in this directory are not likely
to be of interest to just players.  This README also contains a brief
summary of each file in this directory.

If you add a file to this directory, please update this file.  Also,
user lowercase names for the files, and the addition of readme or doc or
txt to the file name is not needed - that is implied in the doc directory.
