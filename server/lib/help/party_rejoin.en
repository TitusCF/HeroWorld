party_rejoin [mode]

Controls whether to rejoin or not party at login.

Valid modes are:

    no: don't rejoin party
    if_exists: if the party exists when you login, and has the same password as when you logged off, you'll join it
    always: if the party doesn't exist, create it with last password; else behaves like if_exists.

With no argument, displays the mode.
