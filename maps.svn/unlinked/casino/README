Casino (well so far only slotmachines)

You will need the Python Plugin running (I've only tested on 2.1 or better however).
Copy CFGamble.py to your /maps/python directory
Make sure you change the path where it will write the jackpots to your /var/crossfire directory
Modify the map links of the slotmachines to point to where your slotmachine scripts are and your slotmachine scripts to point to CFGamble.py
