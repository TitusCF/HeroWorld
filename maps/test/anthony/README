Crossfire maps  /test/anthony

These maps were created for the purposes of studys into controlling various
timed events and actions in crossfire. The specific goal in this case was a
sort of conveyor belt to deliver a sequence of items in order, one item at a
time. The items could be anything from apartment room keys, passports, scrolls
of remove curse, or an increasing bonus of special items for completing a set
of quests in any order they like (assuming the map does not reset :-)

The resulting conveyor belt could also be used to create a ``select a prize''
device, Eg: turn handle untill prize wanted is visible, then make
the `once only' selection of that prize to eject it from the conveyor.

It could also be used to create a rotating display of items this quest
will also you to find. :-)

The maps were created in the following order.
  raffles_cascade    A study version of the raffles prize selector.
  connected_objects  Study of gates/buttons/handles/triggers/altars/etc..
  special_objects    More complex study of special devices.
  roller_cades       Studies into very tight loops for rolling boulders around.
  cascades           A look (and timing) for different types of cascades
  conveyor           Using a straight forward cascade to create an
                     conveyor belt of items.

The result of all these can be seen in the ``Office of Passes'' in Scorn
which unfortunatally requires a fix to get ``gold floors'' to work again.

A Cascade can also be used for other traps!  Like a squeezing wall trap :-)
or timed events, EG: open this, teleport item, create fog, close that.

I have provided these maps as examples and `help' for other people wanting
to create special maps and tricks for their adventure.
