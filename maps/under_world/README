The under_world maps are somewhat analogous.  At current time, it
is but a small selection, but as time passes, a bit of an underworld
could exist, interconnected with each other.  For that reason, they
should follow a layout/naming conventions somewhat similiar to that
of the above world, simply so that interconnects make sense.  If
things are named like 'cave1' 'tunnel16', etc, there is no clear idea
if a cave/tunnel you are making should connect in any way with those.

 Note that the naming here is a bit looser - it is quite so critical
that everything matches up perfectly as on the surface world - this
is largely because the underworld will have fewer interconnections,
and don't really need to use the map tiling as heavily as the surface
world - they may not need to use map tiling at all, and rather have
staircases or other map changers to lead from one area to the next.

For now, for the one I have done, I named it for the map it is mostly on - 
the passage does in fact span two maps.
