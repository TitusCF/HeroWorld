The killpets command is a quick and convenient way to get rid of all your pets when they are no longer useful or are getting in the way. Any equipment they had will be left behind, but you will get no experience for their death. However, it kills them instantaneously.

If a name is specified then only pets with that name will be killed, e.g. killpets bat will kill bats but not bees. If a number is specified, the pet corresponding to that number is killed.
