o There are two classes of summoning spells: Golem-type spells, which summon a creature that will move straight forward attempting to kill any monster blocking the way; and Petmonster-type spells, which summon masses of little helpers, that fight in your cause.
o Use golem-like spells to take down strong enemies. For example: "summon golem", "summon xxx elemental", "staff to snake", "summon avatar".
o Use petmonsters to clear out large maps with creatures of decent level (compared to yours). For example: "summon pet monster", "summon cult monster", "call holy servant".
o As you raise your skill-level, most summoning spells will increase in power.
o It is probably stupid to use *nothing* except summoning spells. But there are situations where a summoner survives while another wizard would have died. Once you have seen the first Balrog fall to your avatar, there will be no doubt about your power.
