statistics shows various useful information about your character. None of the information it shows is stuff that is not contained in the documentation.

As of now, it shows how much experience you need for your next level. It also shows natural, real, and maximum statistic values.

Your natural stat is the stat without any items/spells applied.

Real is what the current value is (same as in the stat window.)

Maximum is the maximum value for your natural stat.
