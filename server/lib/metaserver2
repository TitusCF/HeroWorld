# metaserver2 values - the new metaserver logic
# The only thing contained in this file is information related to metaserver2
# notification.  If you do not want to advertise your server to the world
# through the metaserver, you do not need to change anything in this file
#
# If you do choose to use the metaservers, all information here must
# be accurate - if you falsify information (claiming your server is something
# it is not), you may get blacklisted from the metaservers, and getting
# yourself back on may be difficult.
#
# This file is broken into 2 sections:  Information about the
# metaservers themselves (noted with metaserver2 in the start
# of the variable names) and information describing the server -
# those names are not prefixed.
#

# set notification to on to send updated to metaservers

metaserver2_notification off

# metaserver2_servers list the metaservers - there can be
# multiple lines to list multiple servers

metaserver2_server http://crossfire.real-time.com/metaserver2/meta_update.php
#metaserver2_server some other URL

# Use localhostname to set your local host name.  Many
# systems want to advertise themselves differently than can be locally
# resolved.  Note: The hostname you put here must resolve to the
# IP address that the update to the metaservers will come from, OR
# the ip address must resolve to this hostname.  In other words,
# either a forward lookup or reverse lookup must point to this
# host.  You must put something here, even if it is just your ip
# address.

localhostname put.your.hostname.here

# Generally, you will not need to use this - it will use the port number
# that the server is using.  However, if you are doing port redirection
# at the firewall level, you may need to change this.  The port number
# the server will use is defined in include/config.h

#portnumber 13327

# Two comments for the metaserver.  The html comment will
# be used on the web pages.  The text comment will be used by
# the client.  Note that the client doesn't have as much space
# to display the information, so you should generally put shorter
# comments there.  There is not any requirement that the
# comments be the same.  If you do use html in your comments, make
# sure that it is all correct - no dangling markups, etc, as
# that would likely result in messed up output on the web page,
# and may warrant blacklisting.

html_comment <b>Put an html comment here.</b>
text_comment Put a comment here.

# The codebase fields are used to note if your server is using
# non standard set of maps, archetypes, or server.  This is free
# form text, but should be kept short.

archbase	Standard
mapbase		Standard
codebase	Standard

# Flags are single character representations of aspects of the
# server - useful if there is limited screen real estate to display
# metaserver information.  Only non standard behavior options are listed -
# there isn't much point to list that a server is free, since most all servers
# are free.  So it is interesting to note is a server is pay for play.
# List of defined flags so far:
#
# $ - pay to play (some form of payment necessary to play on server)
# D - permanent death is set on server
# K - killing of other players allowed (player killing)
#
# These will likely be extended in the future.
