                player for that amount of damage every time the symptoms occur.
                A negative &lt;damage&gt; value produces %-based damage: "&lt;damage&gt;
                -10" means the player's health is reduced by 10% every time the
                symptoms strike.

                Diseases with %-based damage can be dangerous - but not deadly -
                for players of all levels.</td>
