o To practice the art of alchemy, you will
  first need to learn some recipes.
  These can be found in some of the old
  books that are sold in magic shops.
o To earn a little money, you should kill 
  some orcs/goblins and cast the spell 
  "alchemy" over the loot, turning it 
  into small gold nuggets.
o When you know some recipes, you must
  try to collect the listed ingredients.
  Some can be bought in alchemy-shops,
  others must be collected in dungeons.
  To identify unknown minerals or potions
  type "use_skill alchemy".
o Once you got all ingredients to complete
  a recipe, you must put them into your
  cauldron. The amount of ingredients must
  also be correct. Put the cauldron on the
  floor, close it and use the skill
  "alchemy" upon it. If you are lucky, you
  will get what you longed for.
o Use alchemy to earn money as well as for
  creating potions/balms for combat.
