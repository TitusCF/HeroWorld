This contains various directories of presently unused archetypes
or pixmaps.  Some of the archetypes are here because they are not
needed now, but might be useful in future versoins.  Others are
archetypes that were once used, but no longer.  These are here so that
if an old map containing these archetypes is used, it will be known
what these archetypes did.

Directories:
Britan,Gloran,Kanji:  Contains just bitmaps.  Could be useful for
future rune code.

merged:  This contains merged version os archetypes that use
several pixmaps to make one large pixmap (ie, a shop is a 2x2
pixmap.  In the merged directory, it might be stored in 2x2 format).
This makes editing of pixmaps of this type easier.

old: contains old versions of some archetypes.

unused:  archetypes and pixmaps that are presently not used.

xpm_pref: Contains various colored XPM files.  These are files that
have been replace by better colored/nicer looking (IMHO) images.  But rather
than delete thod replaced XPM images, at least keep them around in
case someone would rather use them.

Files:
xpm.template: Contains a template file that has all the 'standard'
colors that will be used for the game.  All pixmaps should only use
these colors.

This directory contains all bitmaps and archetypes which are in 
development phase. Also all unused bitmaps are collected here.
These are very mixed series bitmaps and archetypes and hope that 
this directory (specially obsolete sub-directory) is cleaned 
before distrubution of new version of crossfire.

In obsolete directory contains some bitmaps and archetypes, which 
has become obsolete. Most these are simple duplicates  with existing 
ones or cause other confilcts.

Note that these archetypes and bitmaps are NOT included font, pixmap 
or archetype files used by game. 

Since some archetypes have changed, all maps have to be converted 
(again ;). But this isn't big problem since they have to be converted 
anyway to get face numbers to strings.
