o To become a mighty warrior, you need basically three things: A good weapon, good armour and physical toughness. Then you can kill your foes simply by running into them.
o Physical toughness means you will need high Str (for good attacking power) and Con (for many hitpoints) stats. Look for "potions of Strength/Constitution". Try to get items that speed up your health-regeneration too.
o Weapons will be very important for you. Note that every weapon has certain "attacktypes". Most monsters are vulner- able to one or two attacktypes. Search for artifact weapons and experiment with different weapons on different monsters.
o You should know that there are ways to enchant ordinary weapons.  However, it tends to be very costly. 
o It can be helpful to advance at least a very little bit in divine magic. Spells for healing, curing and protections can save your life more than once.
o Use resist. potions to level up quickly.
o Feeling strong already? Hah - You're a greenhorn unless you can at least kill a titan with one hit!
