Petmode controls how your pets (charmed monsters) will behave.

The options are:

Normal: As you would expect.

SAD (Search and Destroy): Pets will roam and seek out things to attack.

Defend:  Pets will try to stay close and defend you.

Arena: As normal, except that pets will attack other players in the arena.
