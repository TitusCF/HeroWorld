o To practice the art of alchemy, you will first need to learn some recipes. These can be found in some of the old books that are sold in magic shops.
o To earn a little money, you should kill some orcs/goblins and cast the spell "alchemy" over the loot, turning it into small gold nuggets.
o When you know some recipes, you must try to collect the listed ingredients. Some can be bought in alchemy-shops, others must be collected in dungeons. To identify unknown minerals or potions type "use_skill alchemy".
o Once you got all ingredients to complete a recipe, you must put them into your cauldron. The amount of ingredients must also be correct. Put the cauldron on the floor, close it and use the skill "alchemy" upon it. If you are lucky, you will get what you longed for.
o Use alchemy to earn money as well as for creating potions/balms for combat.
