arch/dev/wip
==============================================================================

This directory is a holding area for archetypes that are under development or
are good ideas, but have frozen mid-development for some reason.  That said,
this is not a holding area for large volumes of aborted works.  The primary
use should be to retain works-in-progress for collaborative use and/or to
pass an incomplete work on to another (future?) developer.

It is suggested that each work-in-progress is created in a sub-directory and
that this directory (dev/wip) be used primarily for persistent files.

The archetypes under this directory are invisible to Gridarta CrossfireEditor
by default.  The following is an example of how to easily make these files
accessible in the map editor.

If an archetype in this directory is put into service, remove any unneeded
files and and place the archetype in a directory outside this arch/dev area.

In cases where an archetype is under test, it may be advantageous to provide a
patch that may be used to hook the arch into a map so that other developers
are able to reproduce results.

  $ cd /path/to/sandbox/arch/trunk
  $ ln -s dev/wip wip
