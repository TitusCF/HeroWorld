	These are all items w/ type FLESH. This type is like
	type FOOD, but, FLESH objects inherit properties of 
	their owners. A special def for weight is imployed:
     	item weight is FLESH weight/100 * donor.

	Therefore use a value between 1-100 for FLESH obj. 
	weight. Higher values represent larger fractions of 
	the donor's original mass. Things like the corpse
	should be 100, whereas fingers, eyes, etc are low
	weight value items.
