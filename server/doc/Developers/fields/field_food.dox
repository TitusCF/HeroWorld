            item name&gt;) that must be dropped to activate the altar.

            If &lt;match item name&gt; is set to "money", then the value of the
            sacrificed money must be equal to &lt;drop amount&gt; (ie, if
            food=200, then 200 silver, 20 gold, or 4 platinum will all work.)</td>

		</td><td>                Positive &lt;food bonus&gt; slows down the player's digestion,
                thus he consumes less food. Negative values speed it up.

                Note that food is consumed not only for "being alive", but also
                for healing and mana-regeneration. &lt;food bonus&gt; only
                affects the amount of food consumed for "being alive". Hence,
                even with high &lt;food bonus&gt;, during a fight a player can
                run out of food quickly.</td>

            the duration of the player's mark is finite: about 1 food per 10
            seconds. &lt;mark duration&gt; zero/unset means the mark will stay
            on the player forever.</td>

		</td><td>            The &lt;chance to break&gt; defines the breaking probability when
            this projectile hits an obstacle, e.g. wall or monster. The value is
            the %-chance to break, ranging from 0 (never breaking) to 100
            (breaking at first shot).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_98
		</td><td>            If a counter-value is set (greater zero), the sign/magic_mouth can
            be applied (printing the message) only that many times. For signs
            this really shouldn't be used, while for magic_mouths it is
            extremely helpful. Monsters walking over the magic_mouth do not
            decrease the counter.

            Often, you might want to have a message displayed only one time. For
            example: The player enters your map and you put a magic_mouth to
            tell him about the monsters and how dangerous they look and all.
            Later, when all the monsters are killed and the player leaves the
            map, displaying the same message a second time would be silly. &lt;counter&gt;
            1 does a perfect job in such cases. Otherwise set &lt;counter&gt;
            zero/unset for infinite use (that is the default).</td>
