            Important: &lt;magic bonus&gt; on boots has no effect if there is no

                dependant - If negative, it is not: E.g. "&lt;infection range&gt;
                -6" means creatures can be infected in six square range, and
                &lt;plaque level&gt; doesn't modify that.</td>

            Important: &lt;magic bonus&gt; on girdles has no effect if there is
            no &lt;armor class&gt; set. Girdles shouldn't have &lt;armor class&gt;,
            thus &lt;magic bonus&gt; is pointless here.</td>
