            Movement types other than walking is not the behavior expected from
            a pit, and it should only be used for map-mechanisms (e.g. for
            transporting flying monsters). An interesting side-effect: If this
            flag is enabled, spell effects like fire/snow also make their way
            through the pit.</td>

		</td><td>            If set, the player gets the message when using these movement types
            on top of the object. "invisible 1" should be set in this case. This
            is the typical configuration for a "magic_mouth": The player walks
            through a dungeon and suddenly he gets a message. Use this to create
            some roleplay atmosphere, and to inform the player about possible
            dangers or secrets.</td>
