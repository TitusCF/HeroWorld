# What is CFDialog?
# =================
#
# This is a small set of utility classes, to help you create complex dialogs.
# It is made for those who do not want to bother about complex programming,
# but just want to make a few dialogs that are better than the @match system
# used in the server.
# You will not normally use this directly, but will instead want to call 
# dialog/npc_dialog.py which will handle most common uses for dialogs.
#
# How to use CFDialog
# ===================
#
# First, create a script that imports the DialogRule and Dialog classes. Add
# the following line at the beginning of your script:
#
#   from CFDialog import DialogRule, Dialog
#
# Next, build the dialog by creating a sequence of several rules made up of
# keywords, answers, preconditions, and postconditions.  
#
# - Keywords are what the rule answers to.  For example, if you want a rule to
#   trigger when the player says "hi", then "hi" must appear in the keyword
#   list.  One or more keywords are specified in a string list in the form
#   ["keyword1", "keyword2" ...].  A "*" character is a special keyword that
#   means: "match everything", and is useful to create rules that provide
#   generic answers no matter what the player character says.
#
#   NOTE:  Like the @match system, CFDialog converts both keywords and the
#          things the player says to lowercase before checking for a match,
#          so it is never necessary to include multiple keywords that only
#          differ in case.
#
# - Answers are what the rule will respond, or say, to the player when it is
#   triggered.  This is what the NPC replies to the player. Answers are stored
#   in a list of one or more strings in the form ["Answer1", "Answer2" ...].
#   When there is more than one answer in that list, each time the rule is
#   triggered, a single random reply will be selected from the list.
#
#   NOTE:  Answers may contain line breaks.  To insert one, use "\n".
#
# - Preconditions are checks that must pass in order for a rule to be 
#   triggered. The checks that can be used are to be found in dialog/pre/*.py
#   Each file describes how to use the check in question.
#
# - Postconditions are changes that should be made to the player and/or the 
#   game world after the rule triggers. The effects that are available are to
#   be found in dialog/post/*.py Each file describes how to use the effect in
#   question.
#
# - Replies are what the player will be informed of possible replies.
#   Each should be an array in the form [word, text, type], with
#   'word' the actual word the player should say, 'text' the text the player
#   will actually say if she says the word, 'type' an optional integer
#   to specify if the text is a regular sentence (0), a reply (1) or a question
#   to ask (2).
#
#
# Once the rules are all defined, assemble them into a dialog.  Each dialog
# involves somebody who triggers it, somebody who answers, and also a unique
# name so it cannot be confused with other dialogs.  Typically, the "one who
# triggers" will be the player, and the "one who answers" is an NPC the player
# was taking to. You are free to choose whatever you want for the dialog name,
# as long as it contains no whitespace or special characters, and as long as
# it is not used by another dialog.  You can then add the rules you created to
# the dialog. Rules are parsed in a given order, so you must add the most
# generic answer last.
#
#   http://wiki.metalforge.net/doku.php/cfdialog?s=cfdialog#a_simple_example
#
# A more complex example
# ======================
#
# A ./misc/npc_dialog.py script has been written that uses CFDialog, but
# allows the dialog data to be written in JSON format.
# This also permits the inclusion of additional files to take in more rules 
# (this is mostly useful when you have a character who has some specific lines 
# of dialog but also some other lines that are shared with other characters 
# - the character can reference their specific lines of dialog directly and 
# include the general ones. 
#
# ../scorn/kar/gork.msg is an example that uses multiple keywords and multiple
# precondition values.  Whereas the above example has a linear and predicable
# conversation paths, note how a conversation with Gork can fork, merge, and
# loop back on itself.  The example also illustrates how CFDialog can allow
# dialogs to affect how other NPCs react to a player.  ../scorn/kar/mork.msg
# is a completely different dialog, but it is part of a quest that requires
# the player to interact with both NPCs in a specific way before the quest
# prize can be obtained.  With the old @match system, once the player knew
# the key words, he could short-circuit the conversation the map designer
# intended to occur.  CFDialog constrains the player to follow the proper
# conversation thread to qualify to receive the quest reward.
#
# Debugging
# =========
#
# When debugging, if changes are made to this file, the Crossfire Server must
# be restarted for it to register the changes.
