            speed while worn. This kind of bonus is quite desirable for players
            of low- and medium level. High level players usually have fastest
            possible walking speed and thus don't need &lt;speed bonus&gt;
            anymore. Still, this bonus is good for nice artifacts - not
            everything has to be for highest level.</td>

            &lt;experience&gt;. The experience will flow into the skill-category
            the player used for the kill.

            If you create special monsters of tweaked strength/abilities, always
            make sure that the &lt;experience&gt; is set to a reasonable value.
            Compare with existing arches to get a feeling what reasonable means.
            Keep in mind that spell-casting monsters are a lot harder to kill
            than non spell casters!</td>

            Usually this value doesn't need to be set, unless you want
            extraordinarily good/bad quality. If you want to make a shop with
            very high quality, maybe charge an entrance fee, or make the shop
            hard-to-come-by. Note that &lt;quality level&gt; mainly affects
            chance of magic bonus and appearance of artifact-items.</td>

            shops). If zero/unset, the map difficulty will instead be used.

            level&gt; 5 per default).</td>
