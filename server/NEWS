Latest revision news:

If updating from 1.3 or earlier to 1.4, be aware that the location
of some configuration files has moved from ${PREFIX}/share/crossfire
to ${PREFIX}/etc/crossfire. The files in question are:

ban_file  dm_file  exp_table  forbid  motd
settings  skill_params  spell_params

 If you have customized these files, you should manually copy them
over from the old location to the new location.  Like before, the install
process will not clobber these files if they exist.
